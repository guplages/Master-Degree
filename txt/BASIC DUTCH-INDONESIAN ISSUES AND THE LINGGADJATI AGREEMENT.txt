BASIC DUTCH-INDONESIAN ISSUES

AND
THE LINGGADJATI AGREEMENT

 

SUMMARY

The signing of the Linggadjati or Draft Agreement between the rep-
resentatives of the Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic on 25 March 1947
climaxed nearly fourteen months of difficult negotiations. Remaining dif-
ferences in interpretation of the agreenent, however, are so deep and fun-
damental that orderly progress toward final adjustment of Dutch and Indo-
nesian aspirations in the islands cannot be expected,

The fundamental conflict is botweon the Dutch view that the Nether-
lands will continue to be the sovereign power in the Indies until the United
States of Indonesia (USI) is formed, and the Republic's view that Netherlands
sovereignty does not extend over Republican territory in the interim period,
This difference impedes the process of mutual adjustment and jeopardizes any
effort of cithor party directed toward the formation of the USI and the es-
tablishment of a durable relationship between the Netherlands and the Indo-
nesian Republic. Stemming from this basic issue and the mutual distrust
which it has engendered are the following issues which must be adjusted in
the next two years before the USI can be established: (1) the reduction of
military forces on both sides; (2) the restoration of Dutch propertics in
Republican territory to their former owners: (2) the reconciliation of the
foreign tradc policies of the Nethorlands Indics Government and tt Indone-
sian Republic; (4) tho political organization of the.portions of the Indices
which lie outside the Republic; and (5) the control of tho foreign relations
of the Republic.

In the resolution of these ksues, the bargaining positions of the
Netherlands and the Indonesian Republic aro nearly balanced in political,
economic, and military terms, The resultant delays in negotiations are
leading the Dutch to consider an attompt to reach a decision by military
foree, This,in turn, will aggravate anti-Westorn sentiment throughout the
Far East and might lead to a consideration of te dispute by the UN Secur-

ity Council,

ENCLOSURE

1. Background

At the conclusion of World War II a deadlock developed between
Dutch and Indonesian plans for the future. The Dutch hoped to establish
a Commonwealth subject to the Crown, embracing as equals the Netherlands,
Surinam and Curagao in the Western Hemisphere, and the Netherlands Indies,
The newly-formed Republic of Indonesia, however, demanded complete inde-
pendence from the Netherlands. The collapse of Dutch power and prestige
in the early days of orld War IT and the subsequent Japanese occupation
policies of humiliating the white race and stimulating the already strong
nationalistic spirit of the Indonesian peoples, made impossible any re-
turn to the pre-war status quo. As Allied power began to threaten Japan's
position in the Indies, a Japanese-sponsored Independence Preparatory Com-
mittee was formed in Java in the spring of 1945 to lay down tho framework
of an independent Indonesian Republic,

The Republic was proclaimed on 17 August 1945 and imnediately
began to extond its power throughout the Indies following the surrender
of Japan, Allicd rooccupation a month later found Republican governors
in several of the outlying islands and Republican control well established
in Java. Thus, a fait accompli faccd Dutch authorities as they returned
to the Indies and prevented the restoration of Dutch control in Java, Ma~
dura, and Sumatra. Nogotiations to resolve the impasse betwoon the Dutch
and the Republic were delayed until February 1946 by widening hostilitics
between Republic forces on one hand and British and Dutch troops on the
other, Furthermore, the Dutch refused to have anything to do with tho
Prosidont of the Republic, Achmed Sockarno, whom thoy regarded as a traitor,

Negotiations finally began 10 February 1946 through the good of-
fices of Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr, British special representative in tho
Netherlands Indies, and were based upon the Dutch Statement of Policy of
that date. This statement provided for a democratic partnership for the
component parts of the pre-war Kingdom of the Netherlands » With a clear
recognition of the right of Indonesia, after a given period, to elect to
leave the partnership. The Dutch, howcver, expressed the vicw that the
best interests of Indonesia would be served throvgh the continuance of one
realm, Tho Indonesians answered tho Dutch Statcnent on 14 March 1946 with
a counter—proposal including a lettor fron Premior Sjahrir, which demanded
(a) Dutch recognition of Republican sovercignty in the Netherlands Indies,
and (b) the immediate realization of the Indonesians! right to self-deter—
mination. The Republic regarded the Commonwealth suggested by the Dutch
as merely an attempt to restore Dutch control under a new name,

Conversations continuod during March and April with the question
of Sunatra's position within or outside the Republic left in abeyance, Tho
Dutch Protocol of 19 May 1946 recognized Republican de facto authority in
Java, but not in Sumatra. Sumatra, like other areas in tho Indics, was to
be given an opportunity freely to dotermine its own status in the proposed
free state of Indonesia. In June, this Protocol was rejected by the Indo-
nesians, and negotiations wore broken off and were not resumed until carly
in October, by which timo a Dutch Commission-Goncral had arrived in the In+
dics to carry on the talks.

The decleration, on 14 October 1946, of a truco in the Dutch-
Indonesian hostilities helped to ercate fovorable conditions for an adjust-
nent between the opposing views. ‘The Dutch then, on 1 Novenber 1946, vro-
posed recognition of tho Republic's de facto authority in Java and Sunatra
and the inclusicn of the Republic in the Federated States of Indonesia. In
answer, the Indonesians proposed confirre.tion of Dutch economic rights in
Indonesia and a reduction of Dutch forces. Agreoncnt on these points was
reached at the town of Linggadjati (inland from Cheribon) on 12 Novenbor
1946, and the draft agreenent (sec Appondix A) was initicllca three days
later, Both delogations then returnod to their respective governacnts to
obtain authorization for signing.

 

During the succeeding months, moderate members of both governnents
encountered strong opposition from extremist elements. In the Netherlands,
conservative military leaders and businessmen felt that Dutch political and
economic power in the islands was jeopardized by the vague position of the
Crown in the new arrangement (see Appendix A, Article VIII) and by the am-
biguous provisions of Article XIV of the Draft Agreement concerning the
restitution of Dutch property to former owners, In Indonesia, extremists
regarded the Agreement as a diploratic defeat for the Republic because the
Republic had not been given innediate independence,

. The Netherlands Government, despite the Opposition, finally ap-
Proved the Draft Agreement as "basic policy" on 20 Decenber 1946, but its
delay in taking this action had added to Indonesian suspicions of Dutch
intentions and had thus made the position of Indonesian propenents of the
Draft Agreenent nore difficult.

At the end of January 1947, though both the Dutch and the Indo~
nesians declared their readinoss to sign the Lingeadjati Agreonent, they
disagreed as to the conditions of signing, The Dutch insisted that the
Indonesians issue a gencral cease-fire order to implement the truce of
14 October 1946, and agree to the Dutch interpretations of the Agreement,
These interpretations wero onbodied in a statenent by Dutch Overseas Min-
ister Jonknan and in the Elucidating Memorandum of tho Commission-General
presented to the States General on 10 Decomber 1946 in defense of the

tr

¢

Linggadjati Agreenent. The Dutch interpretations stressed that the Nether

lands would romain the sovereign power in the Indics until the cstablishnent
of the USI, and that the Netherlands would maintain adequate military power

there until satisfactory guarantces for tho continuation of Dutch interests

were sceured,

While the cease-fire order was finally issued effective 16 Febru-
ary 1947, the Republic steadfastly refused to be bound by Dutch interpreta-
tions, maintaining that the Republic would recognize only the articles of
the Agreenent itself and the official correspondence between the two dele-
gations, Indonesian opposition to the Linggadjati Agreenent increased
steadily after the initialling of the Dreft Agreonent, cs a result of bit~
ter fighting between Dutch and Indonesian forces and of Dutch insistence on
Republic adherence to their interpretations. In order to forestall rejec-
tion of the Agreenent by the Republic's provisional perlianent, the KNIP,
President Soekarno issuce a presidenticl decree inercasing the nenbership
of that body with represcntatives selectod fron politics] parties nore fa-
vorably disposed to the Agreement. This nove aroused considerable dcbate
and was finelly passed only under the threat of resignation by President
Soekarro and Vice-President Hatta. Final approval of the Linggadjati Agroo-
nent was givon by the KNIP on 5 March 1947 in a vote of confidence in tho
governnent's policies from which tho influcnticl Nationalist and Nas jooni
(Moslem) Parties abstained,

The deadlock over tho inclusion of the Dutch interpretations had
been broken by a letter on 2 March 1947 fron tho Chairman of the Comission~
General to Pronier Sjahrir indicating that the Netherlands Govornnent did
not intend to commit the Republic to these interpretations and that the
right of the Republic to make its own interpretations was clearly under-
stood. This was accepted by Sjahrir on 16 March 1947 and signatures were
finally affixed to tho Linggadjati Agrccnont on 25 March 1947, and a joint
economic cormittee was innediately established to inplenent the economic
provisions in, tho Agrcenont,

2. Renaining Issues

a. The Basic Issue of Sovorcignts
sr ate Sasic issue of Sovorcignty

The signing of the Linggadjati Agreenent left unsettled Many issues
in Dutch-Indonesian relations, The nost inportant disagreenent, which con-
Plicates the resolution of all other issues, is on the question of sove-
reignty. Prominent Indonesian leaders now regard the Republic as an inde-
pendent state, claining thet Dutch de facto recognition of Republican au-
thority in Java, Madura, and Sumatra (see Appendix A, Article I) anounts
to recognition of sovereignty, The Dutch, on the other hand, have enpha-~
sized that the basic sovereign entity envisioned for the Indies in the
Page-42
+

Linggadjati Agreenent is not the Republic but the United States of Indonesia,
in which the Republic is but one of three component parts. The Dutch also
hold that curing the interin period preceding the formation of the USI, the
Netherlands will continue to be the sovereign power in the whole of the
Netherlands Indies,

This basic dissension, together with the strong nutual suspicions
built up through the past year of hostilities and of slow, delicate nego-
tiations, is the nost serious inpecinent to the esteblishnent of new polit-
ical and econonie relationships between the Dutch and the Indonesians,

b. Purpose of the Agreenent

This fundanental difference in views is reflected in the Dutch and
Indonesian opinions as to the general nature and purpose of the Linggadjati
Agreenent. While the Dutch rogard it as o "charter of principles" upon which
a new Dutch-Indonesian partnership can be built, to the Indonesicns it is
nerely a convenient step toward the unaltcrable goal of complete independence.
Indonesien military and political leaders have repeatedly warned the people
that the Agreement is only a temporary measure, thet its signing has not
endec the "national struggle", and thet, if no longer necessery to the na-
tion, it will be abandoned,

¢- Withdrawal of Troops

No progress has been made toward implementing Article XVI of the
Agreement (see Lppendix 4), which provides for a reduction of the armed
forces of both parties directly after the conclusion of the Agreement,

In keeping with their misgivings about Indonesian intentions, the
Dutch desire to maintein their military power in the Indies until there cre
effective guarantees that the new rule of law will be observed by the Indo-
nesians. As a result, the Dutch have been reluctant to implement Article
XVI. The Dutch claim they are observing this icle by initiating neces-
sery measures preparatory to reductions in their troop strength, The Indo-
nesians wont immediate troop reductions without any dilatory preliminaries
and have sought to hasten reduction by suggesting that the rate of restora-
tion of Dutch properties in Republican territory will be @etermined by the
rate of Dutch troop withdrawals. Furthermore, the facts have not been lost
on tho Indonesiens that (a) the Dutch undertook military actbns in Eestorn
Java after the Agreenent had been signed; (b) Dutch troops, said to be re-
placements, continue to arrive; and (¢) the Dutch plan to send 60% of the
1947 draft class of 50,000 men to the Indics, now that overseas duty for
conscripts has been authorized by the State General. For their part, Indo-
nesian irregular groups have announced that they will not disband until the
end of the “revolutionary period",

ad. Restoration of Propertics

in Article XIV of the igrecment, tho Republic recognizes tho clains
of non-Indonosians to the restoration of thoir rights anc the restitution of
their goods. The return to Indonesia of non-Indonesian businessmon end plen-
tation owners, however, will be complicated by economic policies laid down by
the Republic, designed to prevent eny return to colonial monopolistic exploi-
tation of native resources and labor. The Republic will continue to hola
ownership of Stato properties such ag railways, public works, and utilitics,
and of such property as was ownod by Japan in Republ ican territory, Cortain
enterprises, to bo determined ag vitel" by a special Republic conmitteo,
will be expropriated ane their former owners will be indomnifiod, Republic
Minister of Economie Affairs Gani hes ecelared thot the Republic cannot Grant
permission to foreign owners to resume operations before an agreement is
reached between the Owner and the Republic concerning such basic mattors as
wages, worker security, induction of Indonesian personnel into the manage-
ment of the enterprise, land rent, taxation, import and export quotas, end
procuction end distribution policies,

There has been some recent evidence that the single labor orgeniza~
tion of the Republic, SOBSI, is acting as local custodian for foreign plonts,
A long period of delicate negotiations with @ powerful but inexperienced
labor union is in prospect before Dutch economic interests may rosume their
activities, and even thon thoy will be resuncd under greatly restricted cir-
cumstances as compared with their pre-war freedom,

Certain forcign companics havo already reacted to this policy by
demanding assurances that all installations and facilities, as well as
their operations and employees, will be undor tho company's direct and
exclusive control in ordor to facilitate inprovonents in the conditions
of the workers as operations are resumed,

&- Forcign Trado .

The problems of reconciling the foreign trade objectives of the Ro-
public with the trade and shipping controls of tho Dutch also derive from
the conflicts in Dutch and Indonesian views on the Republic's sovercignty
in the interim period. The Dutch trade regulations of 28 Janucry 1947 end
their enforcement, notably in the case of the US vossel "Martin Behrman",
were designed to prevent the Republic's engeging in forcign trade except
through Dutch official channels. The decrees wore justified by the Dutch
on the grounds that tho products sold in trade by the Republic were ob-
tained illicitly fron European estates and were sold indiscriminately at
prices below their value in the world market, thereby progressively impov-
erishing the Indies, The Republic's view was that such trade was not il-
legal under its rights as 2 de facto authority to sell the products of
estates under its control, particularly when the cost of maintenance of

- v
Page-44
-

the estates and labor since the end of the Japanese occupation had been borne
by the Republic. The Republic, by its contention that the formulation of
regulations governing exports, imports, end financial matters in Java, Mo~
dura, and Sumatre are matters for the Republic to decide, has impeded the
operations of the Joint Economic Comittee charged with implementing the
economic provisions of the Linggadjati Agreeent, This, in turn, has shaken
the faith of Dutch business interests in the efficacy of negotiations with
the Republic and has strengthened tho position of those who advocate the use
of force to bring about inplenentaticn of the Linggadjati Agreemont.

£. Formation of the USI

 

In the political sphere » Dutch cnd Indonesian views differ on the
organization of the arcas of the Indics which lie outside the Republic.
The Dutch desiro that the USI ombrace ct least three distinct states, more
or less belanced against cach other, to provent the Republic's achieving
2 dominent position vis-a-vis tho others,

The socond component part of the United States of Indonesia, tho
state of Eest Indonesia, was established at Den Pasar, Bali, on 24 Docember
1946, following « series of conferences, at Molino in July 1946 and ot Pang-
kel Pinang in October 1946, between the Dutch and representatives of the
outlying areas, The future status of Bornco is still indefinite. Pro-
Republican sentiment, especially in South Borneo, has prevented the form -
tion of a unitary state in Borneo. The Dutch neanwhile have sponsored the
formation of a separate state of West Borneo, and are now orgenizing othor
regimes in East and Central Borneo,

The absence of Republic participation in these conferences has led
the Republic to charge tho Dutch with violating Article II of the Linggadjati
Agreement, which provides for Dutch-Republic cooperation in the formation of
the USI. The Republic further has charged that the conferences wore not truly
representative since various pro-Republic groups in the outer islands were not
included. The latter groups have announced thoir support of the Republic in
nuncrous assenblies and broadcast resolutions,

Furthermore, soveral statcnents by Republic officials oppose Dutch
plans to the extent of announcing the Republic's intontion of bringing the
entire archipelago under the Republic's control, Vice-President Hatta has
also declared that the ereation of the USI is "the first step toward tho
unity of the ontire Indoncsien archipelago under the Republic roginc,"

&- Area of the Republic

 

Parallel with Republic cfforts to draw portions of the outlying
islands into its sphere of influence, there have been attenpts to divide
the Republic and to recuce its area, On 25 March 1947, Dutch Ovorscas
Minister Jonkuan stated that Articles III and IV of the Linggadjati

7
Page-45
ft

Agreement "give an opportunity possibly to split the present Republic in such
parts as would desire independence -~ the opportunity has been held open for
Madura, for Sumatra (integrally or in subdivisions), for the Sunda lands, and
whichever other population-groups one might consider, to obtain a position of
their own in the federation (USI) ~—- likewise the possibility exists thet an
area not now part of the Republic's territory may choose for the Republic."

The leaders of the Pasoendan Party, claiming to represent about 12,-
000,000 Sundanese in West Java, proclaimed the independence of a Pasoendan
State from the Republic on 4 May 1947, a development which mast be viewed in
the light of Jonkman's remarks as a part of the Dutch policy aimed at limit-
ing the Republic's territory. The Dutch may also attempt to draw Madura and
portions of Sumatra away from Republican control, capitalizing on Sumatran
antipathy to any rule of Sumatra by Javanese. Continual efforts by the Re-
public to penetrate and strengthen Nationalist and pro-Republican movements
in the outlying islands of the "Malino Area", together with Dutch counter-
efforts to limit the Republic's area of authority and prevent its acquiring
a dominant influence in the Indies, will also constitute a serious obstacle
to the formation of the USI by the planned date of 1 January 1949.

h. Foreign Relations

Dutch-Indonesian differences extend also to the ficld of foreign ro-
lations. The Dutch view is that, since the Netherlands will continuo as the
sovereign power in tho Indies until the formation of the USI, the Indonesians
will not be entitled to conduct independent diplomatic relations until aftor
the USI has come into being. In the iftcrim period, the Dutch plan to admit
Indonesians to the foreign service of the Realm and to conduct foreign rela-
tions, as thoy relate to tho Indios » through a nowly-cstablished Far Eastern
Office of the Foreign Ministry in Batavia.

The Indonesians, however, rogard these plens as merely Dutch inter-
pretations of the Linggadjati Agrecmont which, as such, cannot be considered
as binding upon the Republic. The Republic regards continued Dutch efforts
to retain control of Indonesian representation abroad as en attempt to prove
to the world that Indonesia is still o part of tho Kingdom of tho Nothorlands;
accordingly, the Republic has procceded unilateraily to work out the prelimi-
nary steps for establishing diplomatic relations with Australia, India, tho
Arab League, Egypt, Siom, and Melaya. While the Republie lacks the moans ac-
tually to transport its representatives abroad, its insistence upon its right
to handle its own diplomatic affairs prior to the formtion of the USI, and
the sympathetic attitude of the Arab League, Australia, and India to this con-
tention, will lend an international aspect to Dutch-Indonesian differences on
this question,

i. Arbitration

 

Article XVII of the Linggadjati Agreement states that the Dutch and
the Republic delegations "shall settle by arbitration any dispute which might

¢
Page-46
e

arise from this Agreement and which cannot be solved by joint consultation in
conference between those delegations"; yet there is disagreenent between the
Dutch and Indonesians even upon the matter of scttling their disagrecnents,
The Netherlands interpretation of Article XVII holds that it applies only to
to relations between the Republic and the Netherlands but not to matters per-
taining to the USI as a whole. The text of the Agrcenent seems clearly to
indicate, however, that disputes concerning the USI should be included in ar-
bitration scttlencnts, since the USI is an integral part of the Linggadjati
Agreenent.

i. Conclusions

In ee the Dutch desire to achieve, through the Linggadjati
hgreoenent, (a) the maintenance of Netherlands sovercignty throughout the
Indies until the formation of the USI; (b) the integration of the Repub-
lic 2 federal USI as one of its component parts; and (c) the resto-
ration of economic rights and control of foreign relations.

 

In opposition to these ains, the Indonesian Republic seeks (a) the
free exercise of all the prerogatives of a sovercign state by virtue of the
de facto recognition of its awthority in Java, Madura, end Sunatra, includ~
ing the control of ccononic activities within its territory and the conduct
of its own foreign relations; and (b) tho control of the entire Indics ar-
chipelago through a unitary USI under Republican domination.

 

The resolution of these divergent ains in the future depends upon
the relative bargaining positions in political, cconomic, and nilitary terns
of the two adversaries.

In political torms, the Republic is strong so. long as the presence of
the Dutch in Java and Sunatre constitutes a menace to the Republic's exist-
ence. Moderates and extremists in the governnent of the Republic vigorously
oppose any effort by the Dutch to impose their will by forec, but split apart
te

during negotiations, according to their rm extrene reactions to
Dutch proposals. Indonesian nationalism is cxtcrnally a source of strength
in its unifying force in opposition to Dutch colonialisn, but there is, in-
ternally, an elenent of weakness in its canta, ms, traditional or fostered,
toward the dominant Javanese on the part of other cthnic groups. Such antag-
onisns can be used by the Dutch to further a divide-and-rule strategy and to
convey an impression of weakness and dissension within the Republic.

  

 

  
 

The Netherlands, however, is also politically divided over Indies
policy between conservatives, business interests, and the nilitary on the
one hand, and moderates, liberals, and left-wing elements on the other.
Tne former desire a strong policy ained at the rapid restoration of Dutch
rights in the Indics, while the latter favor negotiated settlement and the
ercation of a partnership of the Netherlands and the Indies as the t best ~~
neans of preserving Dutch influence overseas,

- 10 ~ ogfhs

In international terms, the Republic is strengthened by the sympathy
of Oricntal peoples who are also opposed to Western control, such as India,
Burne, and Vietnan, or who have corrion tics of religion, such as the nations
of the Arab League. The Republic's struggle for independence also engen-
ders widespread sympathy throughout the world, while other nations desiring
access to the resources of the Indies are quite willing to deal with the Re-
public. The Netherlands, however, retains the monopoly on ‘diplomatic repre-
sentation for the Indies and continues to be recognized by other nations as
the sovereign authority over the area.

In economic terms, the Republic possesses great natural wealth but
lacks the technical experience to exploit it to its ow best advantage, and
is prevented from exporting commodities now on hand by stringent Dutch trade
regulations and their enforcement by naval blockade. The Dutch, for their
part, need access to the wealth of Java and Sumatra to acquire the foreign
exchange necessary to finance the rehabilitation of the Netherlands and the
Indies. The prolongation of the presont stalomate will therefore result in
financial and economic hardships to both sides.

In military terms, the Republican forces are less well-equipped and
trained, but these disadvantages are balanced by greater case of mobilize
tion and movement on interior lines of communication. Dutch forces, on the
other hand, must be supplicd across a distance of many thousands of miles,
require a long period of acclimatization to tropical conditions, and possess
complex equipment subject to rapid deterioration in tropical warfare. Fur-
thermore, the cost of maintaining over one hundred thousand troops in the
Indies places a considerable strain on the cconomy of the Netherlanls which
cannot be offset by the proceeds of a normal flow of trade until relative
economic stability is restored.

The Dutch and Indonesian bargaining positions are thus nearly tal-
anced, although the Republic probably can afford some delay better than the
Netherlands, which is under increasing econoric pressure. This pressure is
leading the Dutch to consider serion to reach a 4 ‘ion by
military means, which would rosult in prolonged and costly campaign. This,
in turn, would engender increased anti-Western cling in Asia end might lead
to consideration of the dispute by the United i ons Security Council,

   
  

 

 

  

 

Continued attempts at negotiated sottloment will also be protracted
because of the relative balance of power and tho crucial importance of the
issues involved. Delays in negotiation, rently hopeless stalemates, and
the growth of mutual suspicion and impatience increase the possibility of
arned clashes in the period of adjustment preceding the creation of the USI,
The USI, itself, when and if established, will possess grave weaknesses re-
sulting from its evolution from compromise te compromise, whose non-observ-
ance night easily lead to a final break and the collapse of the whole struc~
ture. Meanwhile, the lack of a settlement continues to make it impossible
for the rich resources of the Netherlands Indies to contribute to the estab-
lishnent of economic stability throughout the world.
