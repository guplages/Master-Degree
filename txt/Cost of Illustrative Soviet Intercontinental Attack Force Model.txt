MEMORANDUM FOR RECIPIENTS OF NIE 1l-8-71

SUBJECT: Cost of Illustrative Soviet Intercontinental Attack
Force Models

1. The attached memorandum Presents estimated costs of the
alternative force projections in NIE ll-8-71, Soviet Intercontinental
Attack Forces. These costs were calculated by the Office of Strategic
Research, CIA, in the same manner as the costs presented in Annex I i
of NIE 11-8-70, and have been noted by the Board of National Estimates
as similarly appropriate aggregate measurements of the costs of the
Projections in NIE ll-8-71.

2. This memorandum is for your information, and is our
final action on this subject. We do not intend this year to coordinate
these cost estimates within the Intelligence Community or to publish
them as an Annex to NIE li-8-71,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF NIE 11-8-71

SUBJECT: Cost of Illustrative Soviet Intercontinental
Attack Force Models

Costing Methodology

1. This memorandum presents estimates of Soviet
,expenditures for each of the illustrative force projec-
tions described in Section X of NIE 11-8-71, SOVIET
INTERCONTINENTAL ATTACK FORCES, dated 21 October 1971,
TOP SECRET, ALL SOURCE. The estimates utilize a direct
costing methodology. This approach begins with a
detailed projection of the forces summarized in Section
X. These forces are then multiplied by estimates of
their unit costs. Finally, the results are summed into
subtotals and totals using expenditure categories similar

to those used by the US Department of Defense.

2. In effect, the costing process amounts to
building a Soviet military budget for intercontinental
attack systems line item by line item from the base up,

using the considerable body of data available on

Soviet deployment practices and on such factors as
manning levels and operating procedures to help deter-
mine unit costs. In fact, the work is done twice:
once in rubles and once in dollars. The ruble figures
represent our estimate of what these forces cost the
Soviet Union and are useful in analyzing trends and
in comparing costs of different forces or programs

as they would appear to Soviet planners and leaders.
The dollar figures represent what these forces would
cost if procured and operated in the US, and are useful
primarily to represent the Soviet level of effort

compared to that of the US.

3. In determining ruble costs, we have sufficiently
good evidence on pay scales and food and clothing allow-
ances for the Soviet armed forces to calculate the
important area of personnel expenditures directly.

For most other expenditure items, however, the work
begins by establishing the dollar price and then
applying a dollar-to-ruble conversion factor to obtain

an estimated ruble cost equivalent.
Page-4
-SEGRET— —s_ -65-s 9065-72.

4. Dollar prices are normally based on the
cost factors used in pricing analogous US items, as
adjusted to reflect the best information available on
the physical make-up of Soviet weapon systems and
Soviet procedures for operating and maintaining them.
Dollar-to-ruble conversion factors are derived by
matching known US dollar prices with Soviet ruble
prices for similar items (the conversion factor used
for Soviet radars, for example, is based on known
Soviet and US prices for non-military electronic
equipment) .

5. Item by item dollar-to-ruble conversions

are necessary because no single dollar-to-ruble

 

relationship can accurately reflect the relative
purchasing power of the ruble and the dollar across
the board for all the different types of resource
inputs that make up defense spending. For example,

‘in the USSR it takes only 20 rubles on the average
to purchase the same military personnel services

that would cost 100 dollars in the US, but about 60

rubles to purchase electronic equipment that would
Page-5
cost 100 dollars. As the mix of the goods and services
purchased by the Soviets changes, the ratio of the
overall cost expressed in rubles to that expressed in
dollars will also be affected. A ruble expenditure
which equates to a certain dollar expenditure in one
year (or force) will not necessarily equate to the same

dollar expenditure in another year (or force).

6. The expenditure estimates presented here
do not include spending for research, development,
test, and evaluation (RDT&E). Comprehensive estimates
of the RDT&E costs specifically attributable to the
intercontinental attack mission are not presently
available, although efforts to develop them are béing

carried out.

7. Expenditures for procurement of equipment and
construction of facilities for new weapon systems
usually begin some two or three years before the
systems become operational.. Since the force projections
in Section X of NIE 11-8-71 give no basis for estimating
pre-deployment costs of weapons which enter service
after 1979, the last year of the projections, the costs

of the illustrative forces are projected only through

1976.
Page-6
Expenditure imates

8. During the 1960s the Soviets engaged in
@ vigorous and costly buildup of intercontinental
attack forces. Expenditures for these forces are
estimated to have grown from about 1.1 billion rubles
($2.5 billion) in 1961 to 2.8 billion rubies ($7.1
billion) in 1969, an increase of almost 150 percent

(see figure).* Soviet investment spending -- that is,

* The illustrative non-SALT forces costed in this memorandum are
roughly comparable ‘in concept to the forces projected in NIE
11-8-70. Any direct comparison between the costs presented in
this memorandum and those presented in Annex I of NIE 11 -8-70,
however, would be misleading for several reasons:

a) The price bases for both Soviet and US military spending
were recently updated. These changes were made to reflect
a general revision of prices in the USSR -- the first since
1955 -- and considerable inflation in US costs from 1968 to
1970. The ruble costs of the Soviet forces that appear in
thts memorandum are thus expressed in constant 1968 rubles
and the dollar valuations in. constant 1970 dollars, in
contrast to Annex I of NIE 11-8-70, which used constant 1955.
rubles and constant 1968 dollars.

b) This year's force projections utilize new evidence and gjudg-
ments, as set forth in the body of NIE 11-8-71. Particularly
important in its influence on costing ts the asswned intro-
duction of accurate MIRV warheads at a later date than in
NIE 11-8-70, This change results in considerable differences
in cost raties between 1970 and 1971 force projections.

e) The time periods covered have changed.

The net effect of these and lesser changes ts, as noted, to
render meaningless any direct comparison between these figures
and those in Annex: I of NIE 11-8-70.

for procurement of equipment and for construction of
facilities -- for intercontinental attack forces
leveled off in 1969, Although Soviet expenditures for
Operation and maintenance continued to rise in 1970,
reduced procurement and construction spending resulted

in an 8 percent decrease in total expenditures.

9. For each of the illustrative Soviet force
projections, expenditures continue to decline in 1971
and 1972. This decrease in spending is primarily a
reflection of the ending of Ss-9, SS-11, and $S-13
deployment. Although all the illustrative forces
Project some further improvement in ICBM capabilities,
this does not show up clearly in the operational

numbers and related cost figures before 1973-1974,

Forces Under a SALT A reement

Soviet effort under an assumed arms limitation agree-
ment, and SALT Force 2, which illustrates a maximum

Soviet effort under the same arms limitation agreement,

rubles ($4.6 billion) and 2.2 billion rubles ($5.3
billion) over the next five years. SALT Force 1 --
developed under the premise that with an arms limitation
agreement the Soviets would be concerned primarily with
the survivability of their strategic forces and the re-
tention of a strong retaliatory capability against US
programmed forces -- would require an average annual

expenditure about 75 percent of the 1961-1970 average.

11. In contrast, SALT Force 2, which represents
a Soviet attempt.to. improve counterforce and retaliatory
capabilities by an early deployment of MIRVs, would
require annual expenditures about equal to the 1961-
1970 average. To facilitate cost comparisons with the
non-SALT force projections, the two SALT forces do
not include the costs of the 120 SS-11 silos and 66
new-type silos at Derazhnya and Pervomaysk -- although
those silos would be counted as ICBM launchers under
any SALT agreement. For-differing agency views as to
whether these launchers at Derazhnya and Pervomaysk

are primarily intended for peripheral or inter-

continental attack, see Annex F and paragraph 255 of

NIE 11-8-71, SOVIET INTERCONTINENTAL ATTACK FORCES.
Inclusion of expenditures related to these silos would
increase average annual expenditures by about 0.2

billion rubles ($0.4 billion) for either SALT forces.

Forces Outside a SALT Agreement

12. Force 1, which illustrates a minimum Soviet
posture for deterrence against US programmed forces
without an arms limitation agreement, would result in
considerable savings compared with Soviet expenditures
during recent years. Over the period 1971-1976, Force
1 would require an average annual expenditure of about
1.3 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) -- only about 60
percent of the 1961-1970 average, with expenditures
falling throughout the period. The reduced level of
spending for this force arises from the fact that it
assumes deactivation of most of the older ICBMs and
only modest force improvements incorporating compara-

tively little technical advance.

13. Force 2 is a set of three illustrative forces

that are intended to represent the most likely way the
Page-10
-SEGREF = = =_ ~-"eS_s¢0065.72

Soviets could maintain strong retaliatory capabilities
against a range of US threats. Forces 2A and 2B

assume the Soviets are successful in developing MIRVs

at an early date, although in force 2B the accuracy of
the new system is no improvement over the accuracy of
current missile systems. Each of these forces would
require an average yearly expenditure of around 1.8
billion rubles ($4.9 billion) -- about 85 percent of
the 1961-1970 average. Expenditures for both of these
forces would decline throughout the period largely
because the postulated introduction of MIRVs would
permit the Soviets to reduce investment in new launchers
and missiles. In contrast, Force 2C assumes that the
Soviets do not develop MIRVs for several years but
instead follow the more expensive path of deploying
additional ICBM and SLBM launchers. Force 2C would
require average annual expenditures close to the 1961-
1970 average of around 2.1 billion rubles ($5.7 billion)

per year.

14. Force 3, which illustrates the type of effort

the Soviets would have to undertake if they place top
Page-11
priority on acquiring a capability to destroy more than
90 percent of the existing US ICBM force, would require
average annual expenditures about equal to the 1961-1970
average of around 2.2 billion rubles ($5.7 billion) per
year. While it approximates the total for Force 2C,
the increased cost of Force 3 over Forces 2A and 2B
results primarily from additional ICBM deployment and
the rapid introduction of MIRVs in the ICBM force.

As Section X notes, a logical corollary to the expan-
sion of intercontinental attack forces postulated
under this force would be a substantial buildup of
Soviet strategic defense forces. Such a buildup --

on the order of Model IV in NIE 11-3-71, SOVIET
STRATEGIC DEFENSES, dated 25 February 1971, TOP SECRET,
ALL SOURCE.--- would add considerably to the overall

cost implications of this force option.

15. Force 4, which illustrates what we believe
would be a maximum Soviet effort, would require
average annual expenditures more than 50 percent
greater than the 1961-1970 average. The average

annual expenditure of 3.4 billion rubles ($7.8 billion)

- 10 -
Page-12
“SEGREF = —n65-ge9065-32.

over the period 1971-1976 necessary for this force
exceeds: Soviet expenditures for intercontinental attack
forces in any previous year. With the simultaneous
deployment of additional ICBMs and SLBMs at about the
highest sustained rate ever achieved in the past and
rapid technological progress for all Systems, Force

4 represents what we believe to be a maximum peacetime
resource allocation to intercontinental attack forces
“> annual expenditures in 1975 and 1976 would reach the
4.8 billion ruble ($10 billion) mark. As Section X

of NIE 11-8-71 notes, a logical corollary to the
expansion of intercontinental attack forces postulated
under Force 4 -- as was noted for Force 3 -- would be

a substantial buildup of Soviet strategic defense
forces. Such a buildup -- on the order of Model IV

in NIE 11-3-71 -- would add considerably to the overall

cost implications of this force option also.

Validity of the Estimates of Expenditures

16. The validity of these estimates of expendi-

tures depends on the reliability of the underlying

- ll -
Page-13
“SEGRET- = -ze5-s0965-72

estimates of the size and composition of the forces
being costed and on the accuracy of the cost factors
applied to those data. The physical data base reflects
the combined collection and analytical efforts of the
Intelligence Community; its adequacy is discussed in
the earlier portion of Section X of NIE 11-8-71.

Many of the cost factors can necessarily be derived
only from analogous US data and experience and dollar/
ruble conversions. When they could be checked, they
have proven to be reasonably accurate. The expenditure
estimates for the historical period are believed to

be accurate as to trend and level. Projections of
force levels and of costs of new Systems are more
uncertain, and this uncertainty increases as the time

period for the projections is extended,

17. .We believe that the ranking of the illustrative
force postures according to total spending levels is
valid. We are also confident that the estimated
spending for any element -- e.g., ICBMs -- of a given
force projection can be usefully compared with the

estimated spending on the same element in other

illustrative projections. The projected direction
Page-14
SEGREL- —FES—88-.9065—72~

and rate of change in spending for each of the postures

are probably close to the mark,

We are much less certain
about absolute levels of spending.
