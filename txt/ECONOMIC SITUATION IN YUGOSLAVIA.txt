ECONOMIC SITUATION IN YUGOSLAVIA

Strategic Importance of the Yugoslav Economy.

The stability of the Tito Government de-
pends in a large measure on its ability to
maintain a stable economy and to make con-
tinued improvements, both in industrial pro-
duction and living standards. Yugoslavia’s

- break with the USSR prompted various Soviet
economic, as well as political and diplomatic,
pressures by which the USSR apparently
hoped to unseat the Tito Government and
replace it with a Soviet-dominated regime.
Present indications are that the USSR will
continue its economic pressures against Yugo-
slavia and will seek by all the means at its dis-
posal to exploit Yugoslavia’s difficulties in
the hope of hampering the latter’s eco-
nomic progress, fomenting internal unrest,
and undermining the government. Thus
far, the Yugoslav economy has withstood
the shock of these measures and, with
Western assistance, has made economic prog-
ress. The strengthening of the Tito Govern-
ment constitutes a severe political and ideo-
logical setback to the USSR, the repercussions
of which cannot yet be fully evaluated. The
example of a former satellite state which has
broken with the central authority of the
USSR and which is showing economic im-
provement cannot be overlooked by other
satellite and near-satellite nations, nor by
Communists throughout the world. The
damage to Soviet prestige has been accentu-
ated by the general realization both that
Western assistance has brought more benefit
to a socialist country than Soviet promises
and that the West has not interfered in
Yugoslavia’s domestic affairs.

In addition to this political and ideological
setback, Yugoslavia’s defection has denied to
the USSR certain positive economic and stra-
tegic benefits. The USSR can no longer uti-

lize Yugoslavia’s economic-strategic potential
to strengthen its own power position in the
Balkans. Most important, the USSR will
also be denied the strategic benefits which
would result from the development of Yugo-
slav ports and bases on the Adriatic, airfields,
rocket. launching sites, rail lines, roads, stor-
age depots, repair shops, and certain lines
of munitions production. Secondarily, the
USSR and the Satellites can no longer obtain
much-needed Yugoslav non-ferrous metals,
particularly copper and lead; while Western
Europe, particularly Western Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, and the UK will derive new
economic benefits from Yugoslav trade.

Estimate of Economic Trends.

The Yugoslav economy has made a strong:
recovery from the effects of World War II and
by mid-1950 had demonstrated its ability to
make the adjustments necessitated by the
break with the USSR. Production in the
three principal segments of the economy—
agriculture, forestry, and non-ferrous met-
als—is above prewar levels. Output of fer-
rous metals, ferro-alloying elements, coal,
electric power, petroleum, chemicals, textiles,
and machine tools has reached, and in many
instances surpassed, prewar levels. Produc-
tion in most lines is continuing to expand.
The transportation system is supporting more
than twice the prewar volume of traffic and
is, in general, capable of meeting the needs
of an expanding economy.

On the surface, therefore, it would appear
that the Tito regime should have no difficulty
in maintaining a stable economy capable of
supporting the population on a level at least
as high, if not higher, than the prewar stand-
ard. The basic tenets of a socialist regime,
however, have impelled the Tito Govern-

Force have concurred in this report. It contains information available to CIA as of 12

ment to embark on a program of rapid in-
dustrial ion. Thus, the Five Year
Plan (1947-51) as originally conceived, and
even as amended following the break with
the USSR, represents an ambitious program.

Attempts to fulfill the plan are responsible
in part for some of the immediate problems
confronting the Yugoslav Government. Any
effort of this magnitude, particularly when di-
rected by leaders with little experience in
managing an industrial complex, could not
fail to. produce such “soft spots” as excessive
use of equipment with inadequate mainte-
nance and replacements, shortages of indus-
trial managers, engineers, technicians and
skilled laborers, a high rate of labor turnover
and absenteeism, and a low standard of living.
The Tito regime, however, will probably be
able to alleviate most of these troubles within
the next few years.

Tito’s success in strengthening and ex-
panding Yugoslavia’s economy will depend
primarily on the extent to which he realizes
the basic limitations on the rate and extent of
economic development possible in a country
of Yugoslavia’s resources. Yugoslavia has
considerable resources in agriculture, forestry,
and non-ferrous metals—these not only sup-
ply the principal Yugoslav exports but ac-
count for a large portion of’ the national
income—and has ample but not fully ex-
Ploited resources of water power, iron ore,
manganese and chrome ore, low-grade coal,
and non-metallic minerals such as pyrites,
cement, and salt. Yugoslav resources, there-
fore, are adequate to Support gradual indus-
trial expansion considerably beyond prewar
levels.

Yugoslav economic expansion, however, is
limited in rate and scope not only by the size
of the country, but by its deficiencies in cer-
tain raw materials, as well as in a broad
variety of capital equipment. Important raw
material deficiencies include cotton, wool,
metallurgical coking coal, high-grade bitu-
minous coal, certain ferro-alloying elements,
crude oil, and certain raw materials for chem-
icals. Moreover, the timber industry will
eventually be weakened by overcutting and
inadequate reforestation. The capital-equip-
ment shortage cuts across all lines of indus-

try, agriculture, and forestry. The lack of
fabricating facilities and technical knowledge
makes it necessary to purchase most capital
equipment from foreign sources. In addition,
Teplacement parts to maintain existing facili-
ties in sound operating condition must also
be purchased abroad.

Committed to a program of industrial ex-
pansion, Tito faces the complicated problem
of finding sufficient foreign exchange to
maintain a balanced economy. Current ex-
ports of agricultural, forestry, and non-fer-
rous metal products are insufficient to pay
both for capital expansion in these industries,
which have high export potentialities, and
for equipment to increase the country’s over-
all industrial capacity. Moreover, the need
to import the necessary raw materials and
semi-finished and finished products to sup-
port the growing industrial machine is pro-
ducing further strain on the foreign exchange
Position.

At the end of 1949, Tito faced a serious
foreign exchange crisis primarily as a result
of extensive purchases of capital equipment.
He was temporarily extricated from this Pposi-
tion by financial aid from various Western
countries and by an International Monetary
Fund loan. It is not likely, however, that
these loans, coupled with expected foreign
exchange earnings, will make up the Yugoslav
balance-of-payments deficit for at least three
years.

Much of the financial aid already received
has been assigned to the purchase of specific
equipment to increase Yugoslavia’s export
capacity and to reduce Yugoslav dependence
on imports. However, this equipment is not
likely to materially alleviate the foreign ex-
change shortage before the end of 1951 in
view of the time that must elapse before much
of it can be produced, delivered, and in-
stalled—to say nothing of the difficulty of
training personnel in time to operate the
equipment effectively. Meanwhile, foreign
exchange earnings from current exports,
which are not linked with Specific purchases,
as are most loans, must be carefully allocated
to purchase the materials and products neces-
sary to keep a gradually expanding economy
in balanced operation. In its eagerness the

Yugoslav Government has already allocated
a disproportionately large share of its earn-
ings from current exports to the purchase of
capital equipment, and recent Yugoslav esti-
mates of its 1950 capital equipment require-
ments together with the 1950 trade agree-
ments thus far concluded indicate that this
practice is being continued. Thus, unless the
Tito regime lowers its industrial expansion
sights, it will be unable to derive the maxi-
mum benefits from the loans already received
and will probably seek Western aid beyond
that presently contemplated. Meanwhile, in
its efforts to increase industrial capacity rap-
idly and to protect Yugoslavia’s foreign ex-

change position, the Tito regime has thus far
sacrificed the people’s standard of living (still
below prewar). Popular dissatisfaction with
living conditions poses no real threat to the
government as long as it uses police state
methods, and living standards will rise only
slowly if present emphasis on industrial ex-
pansion is continued. Although allocating
greater supplies of food and materials to
consumer industries would force Tito to mod-
ify his industrial expansion program, the pop-
ularity of the government would increase and
labor problems such as absenteeism and rapid
turnover would be alleviated.

ANALYSIS OF PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

Agriculture and Forestry.

Agriculture made a remarkable recovery
after the war, reaching prewar levels in most
categories by 1949. Current grain production
provides an exportable surplus of 400,000 to
500,000 metric tons, and other crops, particu-
larly the industrial types, have increased sig-
nificantly. Livestock numbers, with the ex-
ception of horses, reached’ and in some cases
exceeded prewar. Although as a result of
UNRRA aid the 1948 number of tractors
(6,500) was double the prewar number, prog-
ress in restoring other farm machinery and
equipment has been slow. The collectiviza-
tion program has been progressing at a rapid
rate since 1948 and the government’s control
over agriculture is being strengthened
through cooperatives.

The timber cut is greater today than at any
time in the history of the country, and the
value of forestry products exports is greater
than that of any other commodity. Current
government efforts to obtain equipment
abroad are designed further to expand ship-
ments of semi-finished and finished wood. The
major weakness in the generally satisfactory
condition of the lumber industry lies in the
present practice of overcutting and the Jack
of adequate reforestation.

Industry.

Yugoslav non-ferrous metal resources rank
among the largest in Europe and provide an
important percentage of national income and
foreign exchange. Although non-ferrous
mines and plants were severely damaged
during the war and complete rehabilitation

Although ferrous metal production is gen-
erally above prewar levels, it does not supply
domestic requirements. Raw materials for
iron and steel production are plentiful with
the exception of metallurgical coke, but the
old and inefficiently operated foundries and
steel mills lack sufficient capacity to satisfy
industry’s needs. Domestic production must
be supplemented by such imports as scrap

iron, cast and rolled iron, rolled steel, steel
bars, and special high quality steels. Present
plans to modernize and expand existing fa-
cilities and to construct new installations are
heavily dependent upon foreign assistance.

Production of chromium and manganese
has made large percentage gains over prewar,
but only chromium among the ferro-alloying
elements is sufficient to meet internal needs.
Resources of manganese and molybdenum,
and possibly vanadium and titanium, are ade-
quate for domestic requirements. Until ex-
ploited, however, small quantities of these
metals must be imported.

Production of fuels and power is generally
above prewar levels. Coal output in 1949 was
approximately double the 1939 figure and the
relatively minor shortages that exist are the
result of lower quality and increased require-
ments. Electric power production has also
more than doubled over the same period. In
the field of petroleum, crude output increased
since prewar from 1,000 metric tons to an es-
timated 63,000 tons. Meanwhile, refinery
output is still about 20 percent below 1939,
and steps are being taken to purchase addi-
tional refining equipment. There are no
cracking facilities. Yugoslavia must still im-
port crude oil and petroleum products includ-
ing aviation gasoline and lubricating oil.

Except for petroleum and metallurgical cok-
ing coal, Yugoslavia is self-sufficient in fuel
and power resources. Large quantities of lig-
nite and brown coal are scattered widely over
the country, but good grades of bituminous
are scarce. Coal, together with the adequate
supply of fuel wood, furnishes between 80 and
85 percent of all fuel and power requirements.
Less than 10 percent of Yugoslavia’s large po-
tential water. power is presently developed.
Petroleum and natural gas fields, however,
would probably not produce enough of either
product to satisfy increasing requirements,
even if fully exploited.

The major lines of chemicals reflect a gen-
eral improvement in 1949 over the prewar pro-
duction levels. War damage in the chemical
industry was largely restored by the end of
1946. Despite the fact that much of the us-
able machinery is old and many of the proc-
esses relatively obsolete, it is estimated that
the main goals for increased capacity by the
end of 1951 are generally feasible. The goals
for production in some cases will not be
achieved, however, because of the shortage of
materials, the lack of export markets or the
inability to use the commodity domestically.

The presently small chemical industry can
be expanded to permit Yugoslavia to approach
self-sufficiency. Enough progress has been

In the past, Yugoslavia has had to import:
salt, potash, and phosphate rock. Although
present agricultural production is not de-
pendent upon substantial foreign supplies of
the last two items, any long-range plan to in-
crease agricultural production and exports
would require extensive use of fertilizers and

duction, sufficient fabricating capacity exists
to meet demands for most finished products.

Current production of textiles has increased
over the prewar years. Output is still small,
however, and production does not fulfill do-
mestic requirements. Approximately 80 per-
cent of the raw materials, principally fibers,
yarns, and thread, must be imported in order
to maintain production. The shortages in
Taw materials which developed after the
Cominform rift will probably be relieved dur-
ing 1950. The industry plays a relatively im-
portant. role in the economy of the country,
although operating exclusively for the home
market and competing with the handspun
and handwoven textiles produced by the peas-
ants.

One of the greatest obstacles to Yugoslav in-
dustrial expansion is the virtual absence of a
machine tool industry and the tremendous
shortage of production equipment and quali-
fied technicians to set up and operate the
equipment. Most of the machine tools pres-
ently available in Yugoslavia are dismantled
reparations equipment; if substantially over-
hauled, they could equip a dozen or more large
factories and satisfy the immediate require-
ments of maintenance shops. Yugoslavia is
thus in no position to manufacture the pro-
duction equipment upon which all the major
programs for expanding industrial, agricul-
tural, and forestry production are based. Pro-

b- Attainment of goal depends on receipt
and installation of new equipment.
c- Attainment of goal likely.

EE 950

duction of machine tools is limited by short-
ages in special types of metal working equip-
ment, electrical equipment, anti-friction bear-
ings, abrasives, and a wide range of compo-
nent parts.

Industrial expansion is further hindered by
the shortage of technical manpower to effi-
ciently set up, operate, and repair equipment.
Installation of industrial equipment is cur-
rently scheduled at @ more rapid rate than
domestic engineers, technicians, and skilled
laborers can be trained. The service of some
Germans and Italians has already been pro-
cured, but will not solve the problem and
Yugoslavia is currently intensifying its efforts
to recruit more assistance. Capital equip-
ment imported from the West will not be ef-
ficiently utilized unless such assistance is ob-
tained.

The present high rate of labor turnover and
absenteeism arising from worker dissatisfac-
tion is creating additional problems in the
labor force, but the government will probably
be able to alleviate this situation in the com-
ing year. Measures were taken early in 1950
to tighten control.

Living Standards.

Consumption levels are below prewar. Liv-
ing costs have increased faster than wages.
Practically all consumer goods and food are

on
Page-12
nip

rationed, and housing conditions are improv-
ing but are still below prewar in urban areas.
This disregard of living standards as opposed
to emphasis on developing heavy industry is
typical of planned economies patterned along
Soviet lines. As long as strong police state
methods are used to keep the population un-
der control, however, the regime will not be
seriously threatened.

Transportation.

Yugoslav railways carry on a ton-kilometer
basis 92 percent of the inland freight. A com-
bination of over-exploitation and inadequate
maintenance and replacement of track and
equipment has placed a heavy strain on the
rail system. The addition of some new lines
and equipment, and improved traffic control,
however, have permitted rail traffic to more
than double the peak prewar volume. Cur-
rent emphasis on the production of rail equip-
ment will gradually strengthen the system
and enable it to meet the needs of the ex-
panding economy.

The Cominform break greatly reduced
Yugoslavia’s Danubian commerce, making the
inland fleet, previously under strength, ade-
quate for domestic traffic. Planned increases
in domestic waterway traffic will relieve the
railways, particularly in the Sava valley,
through which the heaviest rail traffic moves.

Motor transport is insignificant though it
has some function on short hauls. Roads are

 

11

primitive; motor vehicles are few and in poor
repair; maintenance equipment and person-
nel are inadequate, and motor vehicle produc-
tion and repair are dependent on imports for
many basic components. Nevertheless, high-
way transport is being developed and is grad-
ually increasing the flexibility of the trans-
portation system. Civil air transport is of
minor importance. Its significance lies al-
most wholly in its military implications and
its ability to provide some rapid communica-
tions for government officials.

Domestic Finance.

In 1947 the State Budget became an in-
strument of State Planning and has since re-
flected the direction of government economic
effort and expenditures. In 1949 the planned
budgetary expenditures of 162 billion dinars
were almost double that for 1947 reflecting
both the increased role of government in the
economy and a rise in prices.

The largest expenditures in 1949 were
marked for the operation of and investment
in state enterprises and for national defense.
These categories accounted for about 30 per-
cent and 15 percent of total budgetary ex-
penditures. respectively. The defense figure
does not include that part of the appropria-
tions for State Administration which are
marked for “security” organs nor does it in-
clude the value of services rendered by other
Ministries to the armed forces. As previously
noted, these heavy allocations for investment

and the military have been a deterrent to im-
proved living conditions and were financed
primarily through the turnover tax which re-
duced the purchasing Power of the consumer,
‘thereby limiting the inflationary pressure.

National income in 1949 totalled about 228
billion dinars and was approximately 20 per-
cent above that for 1948. This was primarily
the result of production increase and to a les-
ser extent was probably also attributable to
Price increases. The high ratio of investment
to national income is another réflection of
the intense effort to expand the productive
capacity of the economy. Although it had
dropped from about 35 Percent in 1948 to ap-
proximately 27 percent in 1949, the 1950 plan
calls for a level of investment over 36 percent
of national income.

" Foreign Trade and Finance.

Yugoslavia’s currently tight foreign ex-
change position stems basically from the fact
that Yugoslavia’s exportable surplus does not
earn enough to purchase: (1) the equipment
needed to meet planned increases in the out-
put of exportable goods; (2) the raw materials
and equipment needed to keep the expanding
economy in balance; and (3) the imports
needed to permit a rapid industrialization of
the economy and an increase in the standard
of living.

In comparison with the suddenness of Tito’s
Political split with the Cominform, trade ties
were severed gradually from June 1948 to the
spring of 1949, thus Permitting Yugoslavia

Immediate stoppages were. principally pe-
troleum from Rumania and Albania, cotton
from the USSR, and, obviously military sup-
Plies; coke deliveries were sharply reduced.
Although there have been numerous reports
of attempts to continue indirect commercial
relations between Yugoslavia and Hungary
and Czechoslovakia, the small volume of trade
that has continued appears to be mainly a
clearing up of old commitments.

Meanwhile, trade agreements with prac-
tically all the OEEC countries were either ini-
tiated or expanded in 1949, with most of the
trade conducted with the UK, Italy, Austria
(excluding USIA), the US, Netherlands, Bel-
gium, Western Germany, and Switzerland.
Leading exports, in order of value, were: tim-
ber and timber products; wheat and corn; and
ores, metals and metal concentrates (prin-
cipally non-ferrous). Livestock and livestock
products, tobacco, cement, textiles, and some
chemicals were exported in smaller quantities,

cals and pharmaceuticals, natural rubber,
fuels (largely petroleum and metallurgical
coke) ; and some ores, metals and metal prod-
ucts (especially semi-fabricated iron and
steel). Economically, Yugoslavia is already
benefiting from the shift of its trade from the
East. Except for Czechoslovakia and to a
lesser extent Hungary, the Soviet area was a
poor source for capital equipment and for
certain semi-finished and finished products.
Furthermore, the Western countries have suc-
cessfully replaced the Soviet orbit as suppliers
of essential raw materials. The West, too,
will benefit from this reorientation of trade,
particularly through imports of Yugoslav
grain and timber. Western Germany es-
pecially will benefit. A re-establishment of
the important prewar complementary rela-
tionship is indicated by the current annual
Yugoslav-West German trade pact totalling
$125 million and representing the largest
single Yugoslav trade agreement.

Following the break with the Cominform
countries in June 1948, Yugoslavia’s gold and
foreign exchange holdings (US and Canadian
dollars, Swiss francs, and pounds sterling)
steadily declined, and by February 1950 had
reached a low of 17.5 million, including the
deposit of almost $8 million with the IMF.
This drop was largely caused by the necessity
of financing purchases of Western industrial
equipment and materials and finished prod-
ucts which the East had failed to supply. The
grant of approximately $60 million in Western
financial assistance during the last half of
1949 and the $20 million US Export-Import
Bank Loan granted in early 1950 prevented
the complete exhaustion of Yugoslavia’s for-
eign exchange reserves, and partially removed
the greatest threat to the continuation of
Yugoslav trade plans. .

Yugoslavia still faces the problem of meet-
ing the large volume of its outstanding obli-
gations. The direction of Yugoslavia toward
the West has made the settlement of prewar
debt and nationalized properties claims an im-
portant issue. As of 1 January 1950, this
question was the main obstacle to the conclu-
sion of a trade agreement with France and
was becoming an important factor in rela-
tions with the US. Under the monarchy,

Yugoslavia incurred a considerable foreign
debt—estimated at about $121 million now
outstanding—which it stopped servicing, ex-
cept for occasional payments, with the advent
of the depression. The Tito Government ac-
knowledged these obligations by stating that
schedules for any future payments would be
dependent on the progress of the country’s
recovery. The Yugoslavs have also acknowl-
edged a debt of $120 million for properties
nationalized under the 1946 nationalization
Jaw or as a result of settlements since then.
In addition, the postwar advances from the
West, particularly the US, represent a sizable
obligation.

Probable Future Developments.

Yugoslavia will continue to expand indus-
try and to collectivize agriculture. Over-all
industrial increases are expected even though
some of the plans will not be fulfilled on time.
However, if an intensive program for further
developing an armament industry is initiated,
as Tito has indicated might be done, it will be
done at the expense of industrial development.

During the next five years steady progress
will be made toward collectivization of agricul-
ture. Even though peasant opposition to col-
lectivization may temporarily decrease pro-
duction somewhat, the government will have
greater control over the procurement and dis-
tribution of agricultural produce and thus a
decline in production will not necessarily de-
crease exports. Income from agricultural
shipments will probably expand because of the
higher proportion of processed foods. Addi-
tional steps will also be taken to diversify agri-
culture in order to further increase production
of industrial crops and attain a higher de-
gree of self-sufficiency.

In an attempt to provide additional  reve-
nue, overcutting of Yugoslavia’s forests will
continue. Success in the drive to export more
semi-finished and finished timber products
will depend largely on increased mechaniza-
tion made possible by current loan agree-
ments.

Some progress will be made in the iron and

steel industry, but achievement of planned
goals by the end of the Five Year Plan is

oo

doubtful. Even if Yugoslavia is successful in
procuring necessary installations and equip-
ment, full operation of facilities will not be
attained before the termination of the plan.

Loans from the US Export-Import Bank and
the UK and the contemplated IBRD loan all
Provide for equipment for the non-ferrous
metal industry. When imports based on these
loans materialize, the industry can be reha-
bilitated and expanded, thereby permitting in-
creased production and exports. The full ef-
fect of this equipment will not be apparent by
1951, but substantial increases are expected
and in general planned goals will be attained.

The capacity of the chemical industry will
be increased by 1951, but the industry will
still be dependent on foreign sources for cer-
tain semi-finished and finished products. The
over-all planned goals for increased capacity
are considered feasible, and completion of the
first coke oven batteries at Zonica and Luka-
vac could supply a large part of requirements
for coal tar derivatives. The synthetic rub-
ber industry will still be dependent on im-
Ports of natural rubber.

In the field of fuel and power, coal produc-
tion will continue to increase but will prob-
ably be unable to keep pace with long-range
industrial expansion unless the quality of coal
mined is improved. Output of crude oil will
also continue to rise but will not satisfy do-
mestic requirements. Refining capacity will
also be short of internal needs and it is not
likely that there will be any cracking capacity
by.the end of 1951. Electric power output will,
show further increases, with a heavy emphasis
on the development of water power. The
original goal of 4.35 billion kwh will not be
achieved, but gains will be sufficient to satisfy
domestic demands.

The general shortage of production equip-
ment will still represent a basic limitation on
economic expansion at the end of 1951.
Equipment requirements for most major lines
of industry and for agriculture and forestry
must be largely satisfied by imports, because
domestic production of equipment will con-
tinue to be inadequate and will be retarded
by shortages of machine tools, engineers, tech-

nicians, and skilled workers. Spare parts for
replacement on existing equipment must also
be imported.

The transportation system will be less de-
pendent on foreign supplies than other seg-
ments of the economy because of the increased
domestic manufacture of tion.
equipment. The system will be ‘capable of in-
creasing its capacity and will Keep pace with
the increasing demands of the economy.

Problems arising out of the shortage of in-
dustrial managers, engineers, technicians,
and skilled laborers will be of lesser magni-
tude by 1951. Assistance from foreign tech-
nicians (Italian, West German, and possibly
US), educational programs, and experience on
the job will improve efficiency. Nevertheless,
present schedules call for installation of new
equipment at such a rapid rate that it will
outrun the availability of trained personnel.

Other labor problems arising from worker
dissatisfaction, such as the high rate of labor
turnover and absenteeism, will be modified by
more stringent government controls. New
measures to meet this problem were intro-
duced at the beginning of 1950. The govern-
ment, however, will still have the problem of
improving working conditions and the stand-
ard of living. Although the living standard
should gradually improve, the rate of progress
will be slowed by continued strenuous efforts
to develop heavy industry. Moreover, when
the program for collectivization of agriculture
is put into full effect, living standards will suf-
fer, particularly in the rural areas. This
Program will bring a decrease in agricultural
production and the government will make its
greatest effort to keep up the living standard
of the industrial workers.

Future economic development within the
basic limitations of labor and material re-
sources will depend in a large measure on the
receipt of foreign loans and the proper allo-
cation of all foreign exchange resources. To
continue expansion, maintain a balanced
economy, and meet its foreign financial obli-
gations, Yugoslavia must import equipment
which can be utilized to increase exportable
surpluses. Current loan agreements have
given such purchases a high priority, but most

of this equipment will probably not be in op- Yugoslavia will not be able to increase exports
eration by 1951 and will not play a large role and other sources of foreign exchange suf-
in correcting the present import balance by _ ficiently to correct the import balance for at
that date. It is estimated, therefore, that least three years.

‘Yugoslav official figures place production for 1949
at 400,000 mt and for 1950 at 485,000 mt; however,
no evidence is available which would indicate that
capacity has been expanded sufficiently since the
war to permit this level of output. On the other
hand, coke imports for 1948 and coke and scrap re-
quirements listed for 1949 and 1950 indicate that
production may be higher than estimated in this
report.

“Attainment of plan improbable.

“Yugoslav official figures for 1949 and 1950 are
109,000 mt and 98,000 mt, respectively. Although
this does not agree with the estimate of this report,
this production might Possibly be achieved.

* Tables relating to foreign trade and foreign exchange should be used with caution. These tables
are not always comparable because, as noted in the footnotes of the individual tables, some are based on
The problems arising out of cross rate discrepancies,
differences in reporting trade data (C.F. and F.OB.), differences in methods of collecting data and the
incompleteness of some data, obviate a meaningful comparison.
