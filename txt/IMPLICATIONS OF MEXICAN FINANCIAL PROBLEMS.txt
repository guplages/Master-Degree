DISCUSSION

The Current Setting 2. Against this backdrop, the recent sharp fall in oil
prices is acting as a catalyst both to increase the
financial burden of Mexico's foreign debt and to
stimulate demands for relief on foreign debt servicing
charges, which will be roughly $18.5 billion in 1986,
including $9.5 billion in interest. At Mexico's current
average oil export price of about $15 per barrel, oil
revenues will be roughly $5 billion less than initially
estimated for 1986. Each additional $1 per barrel
decline in the price would result ih an additional net
$375 million loss ' in annual receipts at an export level

‘This net figure includes a $500 million oil revenue loss and 2
$125 million savings in interest payments,

Position of the Banks

“LL Mexico's 4 February announcement that this
year's financing needs would be $9 billion as a result
of falling oil prices surprised creditors, who believed
the figure overstated true revenue losses, given oil
Drices that prevailed at that time. Previously, the
Mexicans had requested $4-5 billion in net new fi-

nancing for 1986 of which roughly $2.5 billion would

come from commercial banks

20. Should the negotiations drag on, there are a
series of moves the Mexican Government could take
beyond selectively withholding interest payments but
short of declaring a moratorium on all debt, These

steps include:

— Refusing to make payments to commercial banks
on medium- and long-term credits but honoring
other obligations, particularly short-term credits.

— Announcing a scheme that links debt payment to
export performance or some other criteria.

— Declaring 2 moratorium until oil prices stabilize.

ANNEX
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF
OTHER DEBTORS

Although most recent attention has focused on LDC
oil exporters, most LDCs that rely heavily on com-
modity export earnings are in serious financial
condition.

— The price of tin, for example, has fallen by some
40 percent since late 1984, with nearly all of the
decline coming since the collapse of the tin
market late last year.

— Zine, lead, and phosphate prices have declined
sharply over the last year.

— Prices of important LDC agricultural exports,
including rice, palm oil, and coconut oil also
have dropped over the last 12 months.

Indeed, of some 22 key LDC primary commodity
exports, only five have not experienced falling prices
over the past year.

Collectively, these adverse price trends severely
damaged the export performance and debt servicing
prospects of debtors in Africa and Asia. Egypt, for
example, has been hit not only by falling oil prices, but
also by lower prices for cotton, second only to oil as an
Egyptian export. Morocco also experienced falling
export earnings due largely to the drop in the price of
phosphate, which accounts for one-fourth of its ex-
ports. While lower oil prices will benefit oil importers
like Morocco, the effect of the declines in prices of
their export products have, in many cases, been
greater. | 7

The picture is similar in Asia, with the adverse
effects of falling oil prices being accentuated by price
trends for other primary commodities that account for
the bulk of their nonoil imports. For Malaysia the
collapse of the tin market not only means lower prices
for its tin exports, but also perhaps having to put up
funds to cover the International Tin Council's share of
the cost of the collapse.
