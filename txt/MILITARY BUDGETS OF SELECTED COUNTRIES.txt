* Note of caution: The ratio between military expenditures and total national government
expenditures should not be used as 2 basis for comparison between one country’s military expendi-
tures and those of another. Division of governmental responsibilities between national authority
and district or local authority varies widely from country to country and there are wide differences
in the extent of government ownership, operation, and control of production facilities. Reflection
of these differences in the relative size of national budgets renders comparisons between countries,
made on the basis of such ratios, illogical and misleading.

Note: The intelligence organizations of the Departments of State, Army, Navy, and the Air Force
have concurred in this report. It is based en information available to CIA as of 20 June
1949.

because expenditures for national defense under the Five-Year Plan are Kept secret by the gov-
ernment. Also, there is no indication that additional credits of 526.7 million Pesos for military
construction authorized in August 1948 have been incorporated in the budget. Both the army and

omitted. Expenditures for Federal Police and National Gendarmerie are not included.

‘Budgeted. Breakdown into army, ‘air, and navy expenditures for 1948 {s not belfeved to be
entirely accurate and does not check with the total military expenditures for 1948, but is given
here as an indication of the proportionate expenditures for the three services.

“The expense of the Royal Indies Army in Indonesia {s not included in this budget, because it
is supported by the Dutch administration in Indonesia and, probably to a very small extent, by the
Ministry of Overseas Territories. ‘The Netherlands naval, army and air force expenses in Indo-
nesia are also partially met by the Dutch Indonesian budget. The fact that Indonesia has a large
deficit with the Netherlands, which the latter covers by loans, may be attributed largely to Indo-
nesian expenditures for support of Dutch military forces. Indirectly, the burden is borne by the
Dutch Government.

* This figure does not include expenditures for the expansion of the ground forces in connec-
tion with the Five-Power Brussels Pact, for which an additional appropriation will be made.

* Conversion rate: 10 rubles=$1. Conversion of the budget figures into US dollars is difficult
since the ruble is not convertible into any foreign exchange on the established international
money markets. The conversion rate of 10 rubles to $1 reflects more realistically the purchasing
power parity of the Soviet budgetary ruble than the official rate of 5.3 rubles per US dollar, estab-
Ushed in 1936, which is clearly an overvaluation. It is estimated that the actual value of the
ruble is 4 cents in terms of consumer goods to the public while the “budgetary” or industrial ruble
is probably not more than 10 cents. This differentiation in the purchasing power may be ex-
plained by the Soviet system of taxation which is designed to reduce the public consumption to a
minimum in order to divert maximum efforts toward capital goods production. A privilege
granted by the USSR to diplomatic personnel to acquire rubles at the rate of 8 to a dollar fs in-
tended to compensate partly for the official overvaluation of the ruble.

* Total National Government Expenditures (in US Dollars)

Fiscal year beginning: 1 January 1949—$41,540 million (budgeted)

Fiscal year beginning: 1 January 1948—$36,880 million (actual)

“* Estimated.

‘In addition to expenditures listed, it is essential to consider the following:

(1) Benefits accruing to Soviet military potential from Satellite production for USSR
military account, reparations of military nature, and requisitions for maintenance
of occupation forces;

(2) Low per capita cost of maintenance of Soviet armed forces, as contrasted by Western
standards, permitting utilization of larger proportion of military funds for armaments
and supplies;

(3) Breakdown of appropriations for various services not available.

“Estimated at 570 billion current rubles in 1949, 540 billion current rubles in 1948.
