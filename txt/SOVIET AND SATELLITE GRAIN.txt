SOVIET AND SATELLITE GRAIN

(The Grain Situation in the Soviet Union and Specified
Areas Under Soviet Influence in Prewar Years, 1946, 1947
and Production Expectancy in 1950, 1955, and 1960)

SUMMARY

The Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries now under Soviet influence
constitute the largest grain producing area in the world. In prewar years, bread grain
production in the Soviet Union alone was approximately three times that of any
other country. Also, prior to World War II, net grain exports from the Soviet group
of countries’ to outside areas averaged approximately 4.7 million metric tons annually.
In recent years, the production of grain in these countries has been considerably less
than that of prewar. It does not appear likely that prewar annual production of more
than 80 million metric tons of bread grains and around 75 million metric tons of other
grain will be attained until between 1955 and 1960." Because of curtailment of grain
consumption in these countries, however, reserve stocks are being accumulated and
some tonnages are being made available for export.

By 1960, the expectancy in total grain production has been placed at 164.6 million
metric tons as compared with an average production of 155.1 million metric tons dur-
ing the prewar period 1935-1939.

While total production of grain is expected to reach prewar levels before 1960,
the per capita production * is expected to recover to around only 92 percent of prewar
levels by 1960.

The use of the years 1935-1939 as the prewar reference period should not be con-
strued to mean that production in the areas under consideration must reach 1935-1939
average levels before these countries would be in a position to support or participate
in a major war effort as far as cereal food is concerned. For example, in the Soviet
Union, the average 1935-1939 total grain supply is estimated at 505 kilograms‘ per
capita, while during the war year 1944-45 the supply was only 381 kilograms per person
per year. Current estimates of the combined grain production in the Soviet Union
in 1947 indicate a total supply of around 389 kilograms per person per year, a supply
slightly greater than that available during the war years.

The quantity of grain in the Soviet Union available for export, stockpiling, or
other uses from the 1947 harvest which is in the hands of producers and at the dispo-

sition of the government, after domestic utilization at present low levels has been
covered, is estimated to be around 7.5 million metric tons of which 2.7 million metric
tons are bread grains and 4.8 million metric tons are coarse grains. Of these quantities,
some 2.0 million metric tons of bread grains and 1.0 million tons of coarse grains
were harvested within relatively easy access to export points.

As of 4 March 1948, the Soviet Union had made commitments to ship to various
European countries a total of 3.29 million tons of grain of which approximately 1.80
million tons were bread grains and approximately 1.26 million tons were coarse grains.’

There are transportation limitations to the shipment of large quantities of grain
from the Soviet Union which may make it difficult, if not impossible, for the above
commitments to be fulfilled.

Based on present consumption rates, stocks of grain for carry-over, export and
other uses in the Soviet Union in future years may be expected to increase. The degree
to which such surpluses will be stockpiled, released to the non self-suppliers to augment
their low rations, or shipped abroad to build up political prestige or to confuse the
international trade of the capitalistic world will be based, not on our conception of
economic surpluses or deficits, but will be in conformity with the policies of the Krem-
lin.

Shipments of grain from the 1947 harvest by the Satellite countries have been and
will be relatively small. In view of the confusion and disturbances expected in the
Eastern European Satellite countries, resulting from the land reform program to be
followed by collectivization, it is believed that during the next several years the export-
able surpluses of grains will be relatively insignificant in comparison to prewar exports
and that, in general, the future policy may be directed toward inter-Satellite trade or
trade with the East rather than with the Western countries. In years of exceptionally
good harvests, however, or under pressure of political expediency, or as @ means of ob-
taining critically short capital equipment, sporadic shipments to the West may be
expected.

A map showing bread grain production, coarse grain production and total popu-
lation in the Soviet Union and the Satellite countries in 1935-1939 compared to estimates
for 1960 is attached.

INTRODUCTION

Food is a weapon of major significance in establishing and stabilizing peace during
Periods immediately following world wars. This is especially true of countries which
in normal times were not self-sufficient in food Production. Grains, Particularly bread
grains (wheat and rye), occupy first place in world food trade and also are the major
constituents of diets on a world-wide basis.

Food production decreased in most of the countries of the world during and im-
mediately following World War IT and will not recover to prewar levels on a world-
wide basis for a period of several years. This decline in Production has been due to
shortages of farm laborers, draft power, farm machinery, fertilizer, Pesticides, seed,
consumer (incentive) goods available to farmers for purchase or exchange for their
farm products, and in many countries to unstable currency,

The severity of the decline in food production and supply during the war and
Postwar periods has been further Magnified by a net increase in the Population of the

several years.

THE AREA UNDER CONSIDERATION *

The areas included in this analysis are the Soviet Union, Manchuria, and the
following Eastern European countries: Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Ru-
mania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. All of these countries are directly or in-
directly under the influence of the Politburo in Moscow which no doubt will exert a

the Eastern and Western powers.

Production estimates included in this report pertain to quantities actually garnered
and not to unharvested grain. In the Soviet Union, the word production usually
Pertains to so-called “biological” production which is an estimate of grain as it stands
in the field prior to harvesting. Normally the Soviet Union’s estimate of “biological”
production is considerably higher than the quantity of grain harvested because delivery
quotas imposed on farmers are based on “biological” estimates and no allowance is
made for losses in harvesting, which in the Soviet Union are high.

 

‘Data presented on the Soviet Union and the Eastern European Satellite countries, based on present

boundaries, are subject to revision.

The prewar reference years used in this report are two five-year periods, 1933-34
through 1937-38, and 1935 through 1939. The latest prewar period for which com-
parable information is available on production in relation to world trade in grains
during consumption years’ is 1933-34 through 1937-38. The period 1935 through
1939 has been accepted as the conventional prewar reference period for the production
of agricultural products.

The analysis presented in this study is based largely on information obtained from
the Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations, US Department of Agriculture; published
data from the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome and from the Food and
Agricultural Organization of the United Nations; Agricultural Attaché and other re-
ports from missions in the various countries concerned and special reports from the
different intelligence services.

Estimated production for 1950, 1955, and 1960 as. appraised by agricultural special-
ists familiar with the areas concerned takes into consideration the recovery and develop-
mental programs being sponsored by the several governments. These appraisals for
any one period are predicated on the assumption of normal weather conditions.
Although other alternatives are conceivable which might materially change these ap-
proximations, the production expectancies for 1950, 1955, and 1960 are based on the
assumption that the agricultural programs in the Satellite countries will follow the
general patterns that have prevailed in the Soviet Union since the Communist Party
came into power, but with important differences as regards rate, timing, and local
adaptation of the Soviet pattern. In general, this program was first to break up the
estates of large landed proprietors into smaller holdings which were placed in the
Possession of the peasant farmers. Later, in the Soviet Union, these peasant farmers
were forced to pool their land holdings and other means of production into collective
farms under the control of the State. It is believed that the small Jandholders in
certain of the Satellite states will seriously object to the establishment of such collective
farms and that, when this policy is forced upon them, confusion in farm operations
will ensue accompanied by a significant decline in food production. It is expected
that this phase of the program will take place between 1950 and 1955 which accounts
for the relatively low production estimates given in this report for 1955.

It must be borne in mind that all numerical values used in referring to current
and prospective production are only estimates based on certain assumed conditions
even though such words as “approximately”, “about”, “probably”, etc., are sometimes
omitted.

Production and population estimates used in this report are based on information
available as of 15 November 1947. This study will be revised from year to year as more
recent information justifies changes in the estimates.

‘The consumption year in Eastern Europe begins 1 August of the year grain is harvested and
ends 31 July of the following year.

The production of grain during the prewar base period 1935-1939 compared to
estimated current and prospective production through 1960 is summarized in Table 1.
The grain data are summarized and discussed in terms of bread grains,’ coarse grains,’
and total grains including relatively small quantities of rice.

Bread grain production in 1947 is estimated at 62.9 million metric tons which
represents an increase of 2.8 million metric tons (4.7 percent) over the 1946 production

of 60.1 million metric tons, although much less than the average annual production
of 80.9 million metric tons during the five-year prewar period 1935-1939.

During the next three years the production of bread grains, particularly in the
Soviet Union, is expected to increase at a more rapid rate than that of coarse grains
reaching around 74.0 million metric tons by 1950. Between 1951 and 1955 declines
in production in certain Satellite countries are expected to be more than offset by
increases in production in the Soviet Union, Manchuria, and Czechoslovakia. Com-
bined production may be expected to reach around 77.6 million metric -tons, or less
than 5 percent below the prewar average. In all countries, production emphasis will
be placed on bread grains between 1956 and 1960 resulting in a combined production
at the end of the period of around 89.2 million metric tons or more than 10 percent
above the prewar average of 80.9 million metric tons.

3. Coarsx Grams.

The production of coarse grain in 1947 is estimated at 57.9 million metric tons
which is 15.3 million metric tons (36 percent) more than the 42.6 million metric tons
Produced in the poor crop year 1946, yet 15.6 million metric tons (21.2 percent) below
the average annual production during 1935-1939 of 73.5 million metric tons.

Some increase in coarse grain production (around 9.0 million metric tons) may be
expected during the next three years, bringing the 1950 harvest up to approximately
66.7 million metric tons. During the five years 1951 through 1955, a continuing up-
ward trend in the Soviet’ Union will tend to more than offset decreases in the Satellite
states resulting in a net gain of around 3.0 million metric tons, bringing the 1955
Production up to about 69.6 million metric tons. By 1960 coarse grain production
may be expected to approximate 74.8 million metric tons or to exceed slightly the 1935-
1939 average of 73.5 million metric tons.

 

4. Toran Gram.

The 1947 production of total grain in all areas included in this analysis is estimated
to be 121.2 million metric tons which is 18.2 million metric tons (17.7 percent) more
than the 103.0 million metric tons estimated to have been produced in 1946, The 1947
production, however, is 33.9 million metric tons (21.8 percent) below the 1935-1939
average annual production of 155.1 million metric tons.

During the next three years, a general upward trend may be expected in the pro-
duction of all grains resulting in an increase of some 20.0 million metric tons by 1950.
During the period 1951 through 1955, the upward trend in production is expected to
continue in certain countries, particularly in the Soviet Union, which will more than
offset reduced production in certain Satellite countries caused by confusion in farm
activities. The net effect may be expected to result in a 1955 Production of total grain
of around 148.0 million metric tons, nearly 7.0 million’ tons greater than the 1950
Production but still about 4.5 percent below the 1935-1939 average. During the next
five years it is anticipated that all governments under the influence of the Soviet Union
will be encouraged to strive toward increased Production to meet increased domestic re-
quirements and to build up grain stocks. By 1960 Production may be expected to reach
165.0 million metric tons, or between 5 and 10 Percent above the prewar average of
155.1 million metric tons.

RELATIONSHIP OF GRAIN PRODUCTION IN ALL AREAS
TO TOTAL POPULATION

During the period 1955 through 1960, total grain production in the areas under
consideration is expected to increase from around 148.0 million metric tons in 1955 to
around 165.0 million in 1960 as compared with the prewar average production of 155.0
million metric tons (see Table 1). However, since the Populations of these areas are
increasing rapidly (359.6 million in 1955; 379.3 million in 1960 as compared with 328.5
million average 1935-1939; see Table R, Appendix V), a more accurate relationship of

Postwar production to prewar levels can be obtained by expressing grain production
on a per capita basis." This relationship is summarized in Table.2. .

In view of the Telatively rapid increase in total population of the areas under
consideration, the production of grain on a per capita basis will not return to prewar
levels as quickly as the data shown in Table 1 indicate. By 1960 total grain produc-
tion in the area under consideration. is expected to be 106 percent of the 1935-1939
average. On the basis of data Presented in Table 2, the per capita production of grain
in 1960 will have reached about 92 Percent of prewar levels.

The government programs for increasing food production in most of.the countries

to prewar numbers. Such a reduction in numbers of draft animals would, in effect,
release some grain for human consumption or other uses. ‘The Magnitude of this
development cannot be accurately appraised quantitatively at this time, but it is prob-
able that relatively larger quantities of the total grain Production in future years will
be used domestically for human food than was the case during prewar years.

THE GRAIN SITUATION IN THE SOVIET UNION (PRESENT BOUNDARIES)

1. Propucmion.

Grain production in the Soviet Union during the prewar reference period 1935-
1939 compared with estimated current and future production through 1960 is sum-
marized in Table 3. This summary ‘s presented in terms of bread grains, coarse grains,
and total grains including small quantities of rice.

2. Breap Grarns.

The bread grain harvest of approximately 47.1 million metric tons in 1947 represents
an increase of 4 million metric tons (9 percent) over the 43.1 million metric tons
Produced in 1946. Compared to prewar Production, however, the 1947 harvest was
8.6 million metric tons (16 percent) below the average annual harvest of 55.8 million
metric tons in 1935-1939.

During the next few years bread grain production will tend to increase, exceeding
the prewar average by 4-5 Percent in 1955 and by 20 percent or more in 1960.

3. Coarse Grains.

Coarse grain production of approximately 27.7 million metric tons in 1947 was
an increase of 8.5 million metric tons (44 percent) over the 1946 Production * estimated
at 19.2 million metric tons, but was 11.6 million metric tons (42 percent) below the
average annual production during 1935-1939 of 39.3 million metric tons.

Although coarse grain production is expected to increase during the next several
years, the rate probably will be much slower than that of bread grains and is not ex-
pected to reach prewar levels of production much before 1960.

4. Totat Grain.

The 1947 production of all grain including rice, estimated at 75.0 million metric
tons, was 12.5 million metric tons (20 percent) greater than the 1946 Production of
62.5 million metric tons. Compared to production during 1935-1939, however, the
1947 harvest of total grains was 20.3 million metric tons (21 percent) below production
during the prewar base period. It will be noted from Table 3 that the estimated total
production of grain in the Soviet Union is expected to continue to increase at a fairly
constant rate and that in 1960 the total production will reach approximately 108.4
million metric tons or 13.2 million metric tons (14 percent) more than the average
annual production during 1935-1939 of 95.3 million metric tons. .

The production of specified grains in the Soviet Union during prewar years com-
pared to estimated production in 1946 and 1947 is summarized in Table 4.

RELATIONSHIP OF GRAIN PRODUCTION IN THE SOVIET UNION
TO TOTAL POPULATION

It is estimated that the total population in the Soviet Union will increase at a rate
slightly in excess of 1.0 percent per year throughout the duration of the period
covered in this analysis (see Table R, Appendix V). The relationship of grain produc-
tion expressed as bread grains, coarse grains and total grain (including a relatively
small quantity of rice) to total population is shown in Table 5.

On the basis of total production, the 1955 grain harvest in the Soviet Union is ex-
pected to equal the average prewar (1935-1939) harvest (see Table 3). When total
grain production is expressed on a per capita basis, however, the recovery to prewar
levels is much slower. In 1960, for example, the-per capita production of bread grains
will approximate 103 percent of prewar, coarse ne 88 bem and total cereals 97
percent.

- EXPECTANCY .IN 1950, 1955. AND 1960 IN RELATIONSHIP TO: TOTAL
SUPPLIES AVAILABLE DURING THE WAR YEAR 1944-1945

In using the five-year period 1935-1939 as a prewar reference base for grain pro-
duction, it should not be inferred that the various countries under consideration must
again achieve prewar levels of production before they can undertake a major war effort.
In the event of an extreme emergency such as was experienced in World War II,
countries can adjust themselves to significantly smaller quantities per capita than
were available in time of peace.

The data summarized in Table 6 indicate that the grain supplies available in
the Soviet Union on a per capita basis during the consumption year 1947-48 are
somewhat greater than the grain supplies available during the war year 1944-45. It
is expected that during subsequent years the per capita production will continue to
increase and will reach a level in 1960-61 of approximately 132 percent of that of
1944-45, but (as indicated in Table 5) about 97 percent of the prewar production during
the five-year period 1935-1939.

THE GRAIN EXPORT POTENTIAL IN THE SOVIET UNION.
AS OF 1 JANUARY 1948

1, Breap Grams,

After deducting allowances for seed, waste, and human consumption from the
1947 garnered (barn) production of wheat and rye, it is estimated that the bread gTain
in the hands of farmers and the grain to be procured by the Soviet government for
stockpiling, export, and other utilization during the consumption year 1 August 1947
to 31 July 1948 is 2.7 million metric tons. The comparable figure for 1946-47 is esti-
mated at 1.5 million metric tons of bread grains (see Table 7).

As of 16 December 1947 the rationing of bread was discontinued in the Soviet Union.
The abandoning of bread rationing will not be followed by a proportionate increase in
bread grain consumption by each of the rationed categories. Self-supplying farmers
will continue to consume approximately 215 kilograms per capita per year. The Armed
Forces are not expected to increase materially their consumption of 260 kilograms per
man per year. Political prisoners and some other categories of consumers will con-
sume little if any more bread than during the rationing period. On the other hand,
workers and employees and their dependents may be expected to increase bread con-
sumption to @ considerable degree. It is believed that additional quantities of grain
required to cover increased consumption from 16 December 1947 until the 1948 harvest
becomes available for utilization in August will not exceed 1.9 million metric tons.
This increased consumption for the remainder of the 1947-48 consumption year was

taken into account in computing the bread grain residual of 2.7 million metric tons
referred to above.

Some low grade wheat and Tye are always fed to livestock and utilized industrially.
On the other nand, barley, oats, and other grains may be, and frequently are, added
to the bread mixture. There is no basis for numerically approximating the quantity
of these and other admixtures actually used, but it may be assumed that they offset
the use of bread grains for purposes other than human consumption.

The bread grain residual of 2.7 million metric tons above domestic utilization from
the 1947 harvest may be further increased by the addition of Potatoes and more water
to the bread mixture, a common practice in Soviet government bakeries,

2. Coarse Grams.

After deducting allowances for seed, waste, industrial utilization, feed for livestock,
and food for human consumption from the 1947 garnered production of coarse grains,
it is calculated that the residual in the hands of farmers and grain available to the
Soviet government for stockpiling, export, or other utilizations during the consumption
year 1 August 1947 to 31 July 1948 is 4.8 million metric tons compared with 0.3 million
metric tons during 1946-47, as shown in Table 8.

3. Gran Srocxs.

There is no information available concerning stocks of grain in the Soviet Union at
the conclusion of World War II. Because of the relatively poor harvests during the
war years, however, it is not considered feasible that reserve stocks of grains could
have been established Prior to the 1946 harvest. Based on current estimates of pro-
duction and utilization of the 1946 harvest, it is believed that the surpluses above do-
mestic utilization of approximately 1.5 million metric tons of bread grains and 0.3
million metric tons of coarse grains were stored as reserve stocks.

4. PorenTiaL EXPorTABLE SURPLUS OF GRAIN FROM 1947 Harvest.

Based on information available as of 15 November 1947, it appears that the quan-
tity of grain from the 1947 harvest at the disposition of the government and in the hands
of producers after domestic utilization has been covered lies between 7 and 8 million
metric tons. The statistical balance indicates a total grain residual of 7.5 million met-
Tic tons of which 2.7 million metric tons are bread grains and 4.8 million tons are coarse
grains. A substantial portion of these tonnages may be exported.

5. Grain Export Commrrments.!

The Soviet Union has made commitments (as of 1 January 1948) to ship to various
European countries a total of 2,365 thousand metric. tons of grain of which 1,190 thou-
sand metric tons were bread grains and 1,175 thousand metric tons were coarse grains.

It Is impossible to estimate the extent to which the Soviet government, under pres-
sure of political expediency, may attempt to ship more grain to Western European coun-
tries than is indicated by the above table of commitments. On the other hand, there
{3 no certainty that the Soviet government will or can fulfill its present commitments.
There are apparent limitations to the shipment of grain in large quantities which will
be diMicult, if not impossible, for the Soviet Union to overcome.

6. TRaNsportation Limrrations,

With few exceptions, bulk grain is not transported by rail in the Soviet Union, but
Is usually sacked in quantities of one quintal (220 pounds) per sack. This requires the
use of more manpower per ton of grain handled than is necessary in most other coun-
tries. Soviet railroads are of wide gauge which necessitates unloading from wide gauge
cars and loading to standard gauge cars at national boundaries or transferring Soviet
boxcars from wide gauge to standard gauge trucks. All railroad equipment in the So-
viet Union is in short supply and much of it is in need of repair.

Loading facilities at the Black Sea and Baltic ports (normally inadequate) were
destroyed or badly damaged during the war. Loading of ships must be accomplished
by crane lifts or by stevedores who actually carry sacks of grain aboard and hand-dump
them into the holds,

These obvious limitations to the handling of large quantities of grain for export
indicate the serious difficulties which may be encountered in meeting their export com-
mitments. On the other hand, the Soviet government may enlist the services of young
enthusiastic party members or Use political and war prisoners to any extent necessary

THE GRAIN SITUATION IN SELECTED EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES!
(PRESENT BOUNDARIES)

Because of incomplete information, it is not Possible to calculate a balance for the
grain situation in the Satellite countries with the same degree of accuracy as was done
in the case of the Soviet Union.

Since the war, current official appraisals of Production have had a pessimistic bias
when not actually falsified by some particular government actuated by the necessity
of keeping reparation levies by the Soviet Union at as low a level as possible or of enlist-
ing the sympathy of UNRRA or the United States to increase allotments for relief and
reconstruction.

Three of the countries in the group under consideration, Finland, Czechoslovakia,
and Albania, were normally importers of grain during the period 1933-34 through

On the other hand, Poland, Hungary, Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria were
normally net exporters, shipping abroad during 1933-34 through 1937-38 an average of

grains together with a negligible quantity of rice.

With the information now available, it is not considered possible to compute a grain
balance for any one of these Eastern European countries. A general idea of the situa-
tion in any given year can be obtained for the area taken as a whole by calculating the
relationship of total production to total population as is summarized in Table 11,

2. Breap Grains (1946 anp 1947 PropuctioN COMPARED TO’ PREWAR),

The combined production of bread grain in 1947 in the Eastern European countries
Included in this analysis taken as a whole is estimated at 15.3 million metric tons, which
is 1.3 million metric tons (8 percent) less than the 16.6 million metric tons produced
in 1946 and 8.9 million metric tons (37 percent) below the average production of 24.2
million metric tons during the prewar base period 1935-1939.

3. Coarse Grains (1946 anp 1947 PropucTION CoMPARED TO PREWAR).

Coarse grain production in 1947, estimated at 21.2 million metric tons, represents
an Increase of 7.4 million metric tons (54 percent) over the 13.8 million metric tons
produced in the preceding year. The drought of 1946 in Eastern Europe was more
acute In the regions where coarse grains are normally grown than in the bread grain
regions. The 1947 harvest was around 3.0 million metric tons (12 percent) below the
prewar average production of 24.3 million metric tons.

4. Totat Grain IncLupine Rice (1946 anp 1947 PRopucTion CoMPARED TO PREWar).

Total production of grain including negligible quantities of rice in 1947 is esti-
mated at 36.6 million metric tons, or an increase of 6.1 million metric tons (20 percent)
over production in 1946 of 30.5 million metric tons. Compared to prewar harvests,
however, the 1947 production was 12.0 million metric tons (25 percent) below the aver-
age production of 48.6 million metric tons during 1935-1939.

5. Propucrion Expectancy In 1950, 1955, anp 1960.

It already appears evident that the Soviet government will eventually impose es-
sentially the same general agricultural policies upon the puppet governments of the
Satellite countries as have prevailed in the Soviet Union during recent years, making
any necessary adjustments to local political and economic conditions. These policies
include further land reform programs in which the large estates are divided into smaller
holdings which are then placed in the possession of peasant farmers. The peasants
change the former pattern of farming to the extent of producing more food for sub-
sistence and using larger quantities of coarse grains for feeding the additional numbers
of livestock they normally acquire in improving their individual food supply. The net
effect of such a change ona country-wide basis is to improve the standard of living for
the peasant farmers, but to reduce the quantity and change the composition of market-
able farm surpluses previously available for feeding the non-farm population or for
export to other countries.

AS a result of the decline in the marketable surpluses of foodstuffs and the difficulty
of assembling such small farm surpluses as are produced, it is expected that the Na-
tional Governments, acting upon the “advice” of the Soviet government, will encourage
or force the peasants to combine their individual small land holdings and livestock into
Collective farm centers. This phase of the program is expected to be strongly resented

2 the peasants in certain countries and the disturbances resulting therefrom will cause
significant decreases in food production. It is believed that this development will occur

Prior to 1955. A quantitative appraisal of the effect of this program upon grain pro-
duction as of 1955 and 1960 is indicated in Table 10.

RELATIONSHIP OF GRAIN PRODUCTION TO TOTAL POPULATION

The population of the Satellite countries in Eastern Europe at the end of the year
1947 is estimated at 89.3 million. It is expected that this combined population will
increase to around 99.6 million by 1960. The relationship of grain production ex-
pressed as bread grains, coarse grains, and total grain to total population is shown in
Table 11.

On a per capita basis, an increase in grain production in the Satellite countries
taken as a whole is expected to continue until around 1950 at which time per capita
production would be approximately 97 percent of production during the prewar base
period. Following the land reform, coarse grain production is expected to build up
more rapidly than bread grain production because the peasants will be more interested
in building up their flocks and herds than in producing surpluses to feed the non-farm
population or to export. Also, in much of this area, corn (a coarse grain) is the prin-
cipal cereal food of the peasants, whereas urban dwellers eat bread grains almost ex-
clusively.

During the period 1956 through 1960, governments will stress the production of
bread grains which may reach around 80 percent of prewar on a per capita basis by
1960. Very little change in the per capita production of coarse grains is to be expected
throughout this period.

It is expected that exportable surpluses of bread grains from Eastern Europe to
Western Europe will be relatively insignificant for many years to come. However, in
years of exceptional harvests, or under pressure of political expediency, or as a means
of obtaining critically short capital equipment, sporadic shipments to the West may be
expected. Nevertheless, until and if there is a shift in the Iron Curtain, the general
policy of the Satellite countries under the tutelage of the Kremlin is expected to be
directed toward inter-Satellite trade with shipments of such over-all surpluses, as may
from time to time develop, toward the East rather than toward the West.

THE GRAIN SITUATION IN MANCHURIA*

Prior to World War II, Manchuria was nearly self-sufficient in the production of
grains. Imports averaged 514 thousand metric tons per year of which 464 thousand
tons were bread grains and 50 thousand tons were rice. Exports averaged 401 thousand
metric tons of which 309 thousand tons were millets and 92 thousand tons were corn.
The net import balance during the period 1933 through 1937 averaged 113 thousand
tons per year, or about one percent of the 10,171 thousand tons used domestically.

1. Breap Grains.

The bread grain harvest in 1947 is estimated at 544 thousand metric tons compared
to 392 thousand tons in 1946, an increase of 152 thousand tons or 39 percent. Compared
to prewar production, however, the 1947 harvest was 437 thousand tons (45 percent)
below the prewar average of 981 thousand tons. It is believed that bread grain produc-
tion will increase in future years and by 1960 will approximate 1,200 thousand tons or
219 thousand tons (22 percent) above prewar production,

2. Coarse Grams.

The production of coarse grains in 1947 is estimated to be 8,930 thousand metric
tons, or a decrease of 600 thousand tons (6 percent) below the 9,531 thousand tons

produced in 1946, Compared to prewar production, the 1947 harvest was 933 thousand

tons (9 percent) below the prewar average production of 9,863 thousand tons. It is
expected that coarse grain production will increase to about 12,400 thousand tons by
1960 or an increase of approximately 25 percent compared to prewar harvests.

3. Toran Grain.

The total grain production including rice in Manchuria during 1947 was 9,688
thousand metric tons. This represents a decrease of 449 thousand tons (4 percent)
below the 10,137 thousand tons produced in 1946 and a decrease of 1,610 thousand
tons (14 percent) below the prewar average production of 11,298 thousand tons. The
production of all grains is expected to increase to 12,130 thousand tons in 1950 (8 per-
cent above prewar) to 13,460 thousand tons in 1955 (20 percent above prewar) and to
14,020 thousand tons in 1960, or 24 percent above prewar production.

RELATIONSHIP OF GRAIN PRODUCTION TO TOTAL POPULATION

Population in Manchuria has been increasing rapidly in recent years (about 1.5
percent per year) and it is expected that the present rate of increase will continue
throughout the period covered in this analysis. The relationship of total population
to grain production is summarized in Table 13.

The production estimates of grains shown in Table 12 indicate that the total harvest
of all cereals in 1950 of 12,130 thousand metric tons will exceed the average annual pro-
duction of 11,298 thousand metric tons during the prewar period by 8 percent. When
the production is expressed on a per capita basis, however, the total grain harvest in
1950 will be about 89 percent of prewar production. By 1960 the per capita production
of bread grains will be approximately 87 percent of prewar; coarse grains about 91 per-
cent and total grains 90 percent of prewar harvests.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF GRAINS IN’ SPECIFIED COUNTRIES

1. Prewar Backerounp.

Two of the areas included in this analysis, the Soviet Union and the group of se-
lected Eastern European countries taken as a whole, were net exporters of grain during
the five-year period 1933-34 through 1937-38, the latest prewar period for which com-
parable data on international trade in grains are available. Manchuria was a net im-
porter of grains.

The Soviet Union imports a small quantity of rice from the Far East, but exported
annually an average of 2,009 thousand metric tons of other grain, of which 851 thousand
tons were bread grains and 1,158 thousand tons were coarse grains. The coarse grain
was composed of 838 thousand tons of barley, 226 thousand tons of corn and 94 thou-
sand tons of oats. In order of their importance, the principal export markets for bread
grains were the United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, and Denmark. Coarse
grain shipments went to Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, and Denmark.

Each of the Eastern European Satellite countries, except Bulgaria, imported rice
totaling 168 thousand metric tons annually, chiefly from Burma and Siam, Bulgaria
exported an average of 1,000 metric tons of rice annually (see Appendix II for details).
Finland was a cereal deficit country importing an average of 159 thousand tons of bread
grains and 82 thousand tons of coarse grains per year. The bulk of these grains origi-
nated overseas, although in some years relatively small quantities were received from
the Danube Basin and Russia. Czechoslovakia was, on balance, a grain deficit country
‘mporting 34 thousand tons of bread grains and 55 thousand tons of coarse grains,
chiefly from the Danube Basin. An average of 20 thousand tons of wheat was exported
annually, chiefly to Austria. Albania imported an average of 35 thousand tons of wheat
and 2 thousand tons of rice per year.

The other five countries were net exporters of cereals. Some grain each year
was shipped from one or another of these countries to Czechoslovakia and in some
years small shipments were made to Finland, but the bulk of the exports were destined
for Western Europe. Rumania was the largest exporter, shipping annually an average
of 360 thousand tons of bread grains and 666 thousand tons of coarse grains, chiefly to
Austria, United Kingdom, and Germany with smaller quantities to almost all of the
other Western European countries. Poland was the second largest exporting country
cf this group and shipped an average of 560 thousand metric tons of bread grains, prin-
cipally to Germany, the Low Countries, and the United Kingdom. Yugoslavia exported
annually 158 thousand tons of bread grains and 487 thousand tons of coarse grains
chiefly to Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Italy. Hungary exported on the aver-
age 585 thousand tons of bread grains (chiefly wheat) and 40 thousand tons of coarse
grains largely to Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and Finland. Bulgaria made small annual
exports averaging 105 thousand tons of bread grains and 96 thousand tons of coarse
grains, chiefly to the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Italy.

The combined average exports from these five countries before the war totaled
1,768 thousand metric tons of bread grains and 1,605 thousand tons of coarse grains, or
3,373 thousand metric tons in all. In addition, Bulgaria exported approximately one
thousand tons of rice per year.

Manchuria imported an average of 464 thousand metric tons of wheat largely from
Australia with relatively small tonnages from Canada, and 50 thousand tons of rice
chiefly from Siam. An average of 309 thousand metric tons of millets and 92 thousand
metric tons of corn were exported each year to Korea and deficit areas within China.

2. CurRRENT TRADE.

Of the three areas included in this analysis (the Soviet Union, the Eastern Euro-
pean Satellite countries, and Manchuria), the Soviet Union is the only area from which
a significant quantity of grains is being exported from the production of 1947. As of
1 January 1948, trade agreements had been concluded between the Soviet Union and
certain European countries for the export of 2,365 thousand metric tons of grains dur-
ing 1947-48. These agreements included 1,190 thousand metric tons of bread grains
and 1,175 thousand metric tons of coarse grains. The European countries involved in
these trade agreements, the cereal grain commitments made by the Soviet Union to each
country, and the shipping program are summarized in Table 9. Further details of cur-
rent international trade in grain of the Eastern European Satellite countries are. given
in Appendix II."

During 1947-48 the deficit of Finland is being covered chiefly by shipments from the
Soviet Union with smaller imports from the United States and Argentina. Czechoslo-
vakia expects to cover the bulk of its deficit by imports from the Soviet Union. Small
shipments of grains were made during the latter part of 1947 from the United States
and Canada, and it is reported that Hungary has supplied or will supply 2 considerable
quantity of wheat (for the credit of the Soviet Union) and that Argentina will supply
up to 30 thousand metric tons. Albania has a small 1947-48 deficit which may remain
uncovered, but grain for military requirements may be imported. Poland’s current
grain deficit has been partially covered by small shipments from the United States and
Canada and large imports from the Soviet Union. Rumania is deficient in small grains
and has received both wheat and barley from the Soviet Union, but is long on corn and
claims to be in the export market with more than one million metric tons. Before the
1947 crop became available, the United States and Argentina shipped considerable
quantities of coarse grains and some bread grains to Rumania. Bulgaria is deficient in
small grains, but has a surplus of corn. The Soviet Union is reported to have shipped
both wheat and barley to Bulgaria for civilian consumption. A recent report indicates
that the Soviet Union will ship an additional 75 thousand metric tons which may have
a military significance. On the other hand, it is reported that Bulgaria has offered
corn to Italy. Although Hungary is statistically deficit in grain for its 1947-48 require-
ments, it is reported that 100 thousand metric tons of grain have been or will be ex-
tracted as reparations due the Soviet Union. This grain is said to be destined for

Czechoslovakia.. Yugoslavia is the only country in Eastern Europe which has:a favor-
able 1947-48 grain balance. Reports up to 1 January 1948 indicate that Yugoslavia
will ship grain (probably corn) to Italy and Belgium.

It is too early to compute a 1947-48 grain balarice for the Eastern European Satel-.
lite countries, but it is evident (as of 1 January 1948) that this area taken as a whole
has deteriorated from its prewar position of producing a net surplus of nearly 2,861
thousand metric tons to a position of being materially deficient in grain production to
cover the 1947-48 consumption requirements.

There is no information available at the present time concerning Manchuria with
regard to recent trade agreements or current negotiations for the import or export of
grain.

A summary of the production, imports, and exports of grain during the five-year
period 1933-34 through 1937-38 for all countries included in this analysis is given in
Table 14.

3. TRapE EXPECTANCY IN 1950, 1955, anp 1960.

It is to be expected during the next three years that the Soviet Union will steadily
increase its grain production and by 1950-51 its export potential will be greater than it
was in 1947-48. During the following ten years the rate of production will tend to in-
crease more rapidly than that of population so that by 1960, surplus production, that is,
production in excess of domestic requirements, may be expected to be 3 or more percent,
greater than before the war. The surplus grain produced in the Soviet Union, however,
cannot be expected to be sufficient to cover the import requirements of Western Europe.

Although considerable improvement may be expected during the next three years in
the grain production of the Eastern European Satellite countries, there is expected to
be a shift away from the production of bread grains toward coarse grains. By 1950-51
little, if any, bread grain tonnage is expected to be available for shipment to Western

Europe though some coarse grain (particularly corn) may be offered for international
trade.

During the following five years, the agriculture of this group of countries is expected
to be in a confused state with a general drop in production, thus further reducing ex-
port potentialities during 1951-56,

Although some improvement in production is to be expected after 1955, it is not
believed that the agricultural potential of these countries will have regained a suffi-
ciently favorable position to enable them to export any considerable quantity of bread
grains to Western Europe or to be a material source of supply to the Soviet Union. It is
not improbable that because of confusion of agricultural production (see Appendix II),

a materially reduced standard of living may be imposed upon the masses of non self-
suppliers in these countries as has been the case in the Soviet Union.

The expectancy in Manchuria is not clear because of the paucity of information.

APPENDIX I

GRAIN SITUATION IN SELECTED EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

1, Tue Prewar Situation.

The Eastern European countries selected for analysis include three countries—
Finland, Czechoslovakia, and Albania, which before the war were deficit in total grain
production, importing during the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938 an aver-
age of 421 thousand metric tons (including rice) to supplement their combined indige-
nous production of 7.1 million metric tons. This indicates a combined total domestic
supply of 7.5 million metric tons for the three importing countries.

The group also includes five countries—Poland, Hungary, Rumania, Yugoslavia,
and Bulgaria, which before the war were surplus in total grain production exporting
during the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938 an average of 3.3 million metric
tons from a combined indigenous production of 38.6 million metric tons. This indicates
a combined total domestic supply of 35.3 million metric tons for the five exporting
countries.

Considering this selected group of eight Eastern European countries as a whole,
the average production of total grains (including small quantities of rice) during the
five-year period 1933-34 through 1937-1938 was 45.7 million metric tons from which
net exports totaled 2.9 million metric tons or 6.3 percent. This indicates an over-all
domestic supply of 42.8 million metric tons.

The group taken as a whole was 107.6 percent self-sufficient in bread grains, 106.6
percent self-sufficient in coarse grains, but 93.3 percent deficient in rice.

Average annual exports (net) during this period averaged:

Wheat 1,037
Rye 523
Bread Grains ‘1,560

Oats 92

There are no comparable data available for imports and exports after the con-
sumption year 1 August 1937 through 31 July 1938. Comparable production data con-
tinue to be available for the years 1938 through 1939 and therefore the average of the

*
23 connyféserrar,
Page-30
five-year period 1935 through 1939 has been conventionally adopted as the prewar com-
parison period for production.

2. Tue 1935-1939 Comparison Base.

Considering the selected Eastern European group of countries as a whole the
1935-1939 production of total grains averaged 48.6 million metric tons or an average
increase of 2.9 million metric tons (6.2 percent) over the 1933-1937 average of 45.7
million metric tons. Although the over-all difference between the two averages is
small, there are often significant differences between countries and crops. Some of
these differences are undoubtedly influenced by fluctuations in weather, but during
the last year or two before the impending conflict was precipitated, significant changes
in acreages were made in certain countries that on balance resulted in a positive up-
ward trend in production. Therefore, the averages of the five-year period 1935-1939
are used when measuring the degree of shifts in the production potential during the
war and postwar years.

3. Tue 1947 Srrvarion.

The 1947 combined total grain production in the selected Eastern European group
of countries has been placed at 36.6 million metric tons which, although 6.1 million
metric tons (20 percent) greater than the low production of 30.5 million tons in the
drought year 1946, was still 9.1 million tons (20.0 percent) below the 1935-1939 average
of 45.7 million tons, and 6.3 million tons (14.6 percent) below the average supply for
domestic utilization of 42.8 million tons during the five-year period 1933-1934 through
1937-1938, :

Because of population increases during 1938 and 1939, these two average differences
from 1947 are not strictly comparable, but they do indicate that the populations of
the area as a whole are in a deficit position in respect to total grains which on balance
indicate the need for imports or, failing these, the necessity of reducing domestic con-
sumption or other utilization.

The low production of 1947, as compared with the prewar averages, is in part
attributable to climatic condition and also to the lowered agricultural potential follow-
ing the devastations of war. Another factor adversely affecting the 1947 agricultural
potential was the land reform instituted at the close of the war in Poland, Hungary,
and Rumania, and to a lesser extent, in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.

4. Breap Grains.

The 1947 combined bread grain production in the selected Eastern European
group of countries has been placed at 15.3 million metric tons which chiefly because of
adverse weather conditions in the winter grain preducing areas was 1.3 million metric
tons (8 percent) below the 16.6 million metric tons produced in 1946 and 8.9 million
metric tons (37 percent) below the 1935-1939 average production of 24.2 million metric
tons. The 1947 production of bread grains was 5.1 million metric tons (25 percent)
less than the 20.4 million metric tons average annual supply for domestic utilization
during the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938.

conifer 24
Page-31
congMersn,

While weather conditions in the winter grain areas played a preponderant role
in depressing the 1947 bread grain production below that of 1946, the relative level
below the prewar averages was determined largely by the land reform (attended by a
shift away from bread grain acreages) and, to a lesser degree, by war devastation that
reduced the quality of the plowing, seeding, and other farm work on such acreages as

were seeded.

5. COARSE GRAINS.

The 1947 combined coarse grain production in the selected Eastern European group
of countries has been placed at 21.2 million metric tons which, although 7.4 million
metric tons (54 percent) more than the 1946 production of 13.8 million tons, was still
3.1 million tons (13 percent) below the 24.3 million tons average production during
the five-year period 1935-1939. The 1947 coarse grain production was 980 thousand
metric tons (4 percent) below the average supply available for domestic utilization
during the five years 1933-1934 through 1937-1938.

The increased production of coarse grains in 1947 of 54 percent over 1946 was
due not only to increased acreages but also to a peculiar combination of weather factors
in the southern spring grain areas that was particularly favorable to corn. The more
favorable relation of the 1947 production of coarse grains to the prewar averages than
that of bread grains was determined to no small degree by a more rapid recovery of
coarse grains following the land reform.

EXPECTANCY IN GRAIN PRODUCTION

During the three years 1948, 1949, and 1950 the general production trend in all
of the selected Eastern European countries will be toward building up the agricultural
potential. It is impossible to foresee the trends in individual countries accurately,
although in Appendix III an attempt has been made to indicate expectancy in produc-
tion for each of these countries in a general way.

1 Dericir Counrriss.

In two of the food deficit countries, Czechoslovakia and Finland, where there has
been little or no effect of the land reform, the immediate trend of production will be
toward building up bread grains at the expense of coarse grains. By 1950, the build-up
in bread grains may result in a production as much as 5 percent above the prewar
1935-1939 average accompanied by a loss in coarse grains of about 5 percent.

During the next five years, the over-all agricultural potential in both countries may
be expected to increase. Bread grains may reach a production level of about 30 per-
cent above prewar and coarse grains about 10 percent above the 1935-1939 average.

The tempo of the agricultural potential during the period 1956 through 1960 may
be expected to slow down, Bread grains may reach a production of 35 to 40 percent

above prewar by 1960, while coarse grains may increase to a level of 10 to 15 percent
above the 1935-1939 average,

2. SuRpLus Countrtss. 7

In the surplus-producing countries — Poland, Hungary, Rumania, Yugoslavia, and
Bulgaria — a general build-up of the agricultural potential from the low level follow-
ing war devastation may be expected during 1948, 1949, and 1950. Because of the
customary trend in peasant agriculture, following a land reform, coarse grains may
be expected to build up more rapidly than bread grains, which by 1950 cannot be ex-
pected to recover to a level of more than 90 to 95 percent of the 1935-1939 average as
compared with coarse grains which may recover to 95 to 100 percent of the prewar
average.

Not only may the 1950 production of bread grains be appreciably below the pre-
war average, but the several governments will find it increasingly difficult to collect
sufficient foodstuffs to feed the non-farm population. Before the war, relatively large
marketable surpluses for urban consumption and export were assembled from each
of a relatively few large landed proprietors. After the land reform, such marketable
surpluses as are available will have to be assembled from thousands of small proprietors.
A similar situation developed in the Soviet Union after the first World War, and the
system of small proprietors had to be abandoned in favor of re-establishing large units
of production which were known as collective farms.

It would have been better economically from the governments’ point of view if
large-scale farming could have been established immediately after the Axis forces had
been driven out of the several countries. But at that time the governments were not
strong enough to risk the violent reaction of the peasants toward having their private
property nationalized and consolidated into socialistic farming units. The support of
the peasants was essential to the security of each of the so-called Communistic govern-
ments. To secure that support, or at least to lessen the opposition of the peasantry,
large estates were expropriated and the land was parceled out to the peasants. This
was contrary to the principles promulgated by the Moscow government in that this
action strengthened the small farmer capitalists and increased their number by trans-
forming landless rural proletariats into small landed capitalists. Not only is private
land ownership in violation of the ideology of the Communists but the operation of a
Socialist state is slowed down, if not threatened, by the difficulty of assembling food and
materials to maintain non self-suppliers. As in the Soviet Union, this situation is
bound to become increasingly serious, and therefore in each of the Satellite States,
governments will sooner or later consider it essential to follow the example of the
Soviet Union and expropriate small land holdings and livestock and establish large
unit areas of production and large collectivized herds.

It is inevitable that such a step will be accompanied by some violence and bloodshed
in the villages just as it was in the Soviet Union. It is to be expected that the confusion
caused by sabotage of reluctant peasants will result in a sharp decline in the agricul-
tural potential. It is assumed that collectivization followed by confusion in agriculture
and a decline in production will occur for the area as a whole. This decline, how-
ever, does not apply to all the countries since Finland and Czechoslovakia are expected
to improve their position. The decline in the other countries will be in varying degrees,

CON! nflewnian 26
Page-33
conngpfrsa

of course, and at different periods within the next few years. Around 1955 the agri-
cultural potential for the area as a whole is expected to be below the level of 1950.

The tables in Appendix III give the productions attributable to the several crops
in each of the specified countries. Taking the export countries as a whole, the drop
in bread grains may be expected to be sharper than that in coarse grains and may
fall to as much as 70 to 75 percent of the 1935-1939 average. Coarse grains may be
expected to fall off to around 90 to 95 percent of prewar.

After collectivization, during which the better peasants probably will be driven out
of the villages or confined in concentration camps, government pressure on the re-
maining peasants may be expected to cause agriculture to regain some of its lost
potentiality during the period 1956 through 1960.

However, such gains prior to 1960 can hardly be expected to bring production up
to the 1950 level. Bread grains may be expected to build up to around 80 percent of
the 1935-1939 average and coarse grains to 85 to 90 percent of prewar.

The foregoing comparisons are intended only to bring out the probability that
postwar recovery of the agricultural potential in the former export countries, now
under the domination of the Moscow government, will receive a set-back sometime
between 1950 and 1960, and that by the latter date these countries can scarcely be ex-
pected to have gained a production position to enable them to export any considerable
quantity of bread grains to Western Europe or to be a material source of supply for
the Soviet Union. It is not improbable that because of the confusion of agricultural
production, a materially reduced standard of living may be imposed upon the masses
of non self-suppliers in each of these countries as has been the case in the Soviet
Union.

THE 1947 PRODUCTION SITUATION IN SPECIFIED EASTERN EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES IN RELATION TO SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE

1. Finranp.

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Finland, with an aver-
age grain production of 1,238 thousand metric tons, imported 17.0 percent of its total
cereal requirement of 1,492 thousand metric tons.

Indigenous production supplied 73 percent of the bread grains, 91 percent of the
coarse grains, but none of the rice used domestically.

Imports during this period averaged 159 thousand metric tons of bread grains,
82 thousand metric tons of coarse grains, and 13 thousand metric tons of rice.

The 1947 total grain production in Finland was placed at 1,032 thousand metric
tons, which was 101 thousand tons (10.8 percent) more than the 931 thousand tons
produced in 1946, but was 289 thousand tons (21.8 percent) below the 1935-1939
average production of 1,321 thousand tons and 460 thousand metric tons below the
1933-1934 through 1937-1938 average domestic requirement.

To meet the consumption requirements of the year 1947-1948, Finland applied to
the International Emergency Food Council for a grain allotment of 373 thousand tons
of bread and coarse grains. After screening by the Cereal Committee, Finlana’s allot-
ment was placed at 284 thousand tons, which, when added to the 1,032 thousand tons
produced domestically would bring the total availability of grain up to the prewar
average. The allotment was apportioned as follows: wheat and rye (including flour
in terms of grain), 214 thousand tons; and coarse grains, 70 thousand tons.

Shipments of wheat and rye (including flour in terms of grains) to Finland during
the six months which ended 31 December 1947 were 59 thousand long tons from the
United States and 42 thousand long tons from Argentina. Since long ton shipments
were counted as metric tons, there remain 113 thousand tons of bread grains and 70
thousand metric tons of coarse grains to be shipped during the first six to seven months
of 1948.

A recent report indicates that the Soviet Union is committed to ship to Finland
before the end of August 1948, 100 thousand metric tons of rye, 70 thousand tons of
wheat, 80 thousand tons of oats, and 5 thousand tons of corn.

The situation in Finland is, at the date of this report, too obscure to more than
indicate a deficit in grain production that will be more or less covered by imports
for the most part from the Soviet Union.

If the Soviet Union fulfills its commitments, Finland will receive slightly more than
271 thousand metric tons of bread grains and 85 thousand metric tons of coarse grains
to supplement indigenous production, bringing the total supply for 1947-1948 up to
more than 1,388 thousand metric tons, or more than 86 percent of the 1933-1934 to
1937-1938 average. 7

2. . POLAND.

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Poland, with an average
production of total grains of 13,355 thousand metric tons, exported 876 thousand
tons or 6.6 percent of its indigenous production of bread grains and coarse grains,
but imported 43 thousand metric tons of rice. This indicates an average total domestic
supply of 12,422 thousand metric tons. .

Poland was 107 percent self-sufficient in bread grains, 107 percent self-sufficient
in coarse grains, but 100 percent deficient in rice.

Exports during this period averaged 560 thousand metric tons of bread grains and
316 thousand metric tons of coarse grains per year.

The 1947 total grain production of Poland was placed at 9,595 thousand metric
tons, which, although 1,403 thousand metric tons (17 percent) above the 1946 produc-
tion of 8,192 thousand metric tons, was still 32 percent below the average production
of 14,328 thousand metric tons during the five-year period 1935-1939 and 2,827 thousand
metric tons (22.8 percent) below the 1933-1934 through 1937-1938 average domestic
supply.

To meet claimed consumption requirements of the year 1947-1948, Poland applied
to International Emergency Food Council for an allotment of 884 thousand metric
tons of total grain. After screening by the Cereal Committee, Poland’s allotment was
placed at 382 thousand metric tons as follows: wheat and rye (including flour in terms
of grain), 327 thousand tons; and coarse grain, 55 thousand tons.

During the six months ended 31 December 1947, the United States and Canada
shipped to Poland the equivalent of 67.7 thousand long tons of bread grains in lieu
of an equal number of metric tons. This would leave 259.3 thousand tons of bread
grains and 55 thousand metric tons. of coarse grains, or a total of about 314 thousand
metric tons to be obtained from other sources.

Poland received a commitment for 240 thousand metric tons of bread grains and
60 thousand metric tons of coarse grains to be shipped from the Soviet Union. It is
reported that this commitment has been fulfilled.

If the allotment made by the International Emergency Food Council is covered,

14 thousand metric tons of grain are still to be received by Poland during the first
six to seven months of 1948.

3. CzecnosLovaKia

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Czechoslovakia; with an
average production of 5,702 thousand metric tons, imported 2.1 percent of its total
6rain requirement of 5,832 thousand metric tons.

Indigenous production supplied 99 percent of the bread grains and 98 percent of
the coarse grains, but none of the rice used domestically.

Imports during this period averaged 14 thousand metric tons of bread grains, 55
thousand tons of coarse grains, and 61 thousand tons of rice per year.

The 1947 grain production of Czechoslovakia is estimated at 4,215 thousand metric
tons which was 562 thousand tons (11.7 percent) below the 1946 production of. 4,777

thousand tons and 1,545 thousand tons (26.8 percent) below the 1935-1939 average,
and 1,617 thousand metric tons below the 1933-1934 through 1937-1938 average do-
mestic requirement.

To meet the consumption requirements of the year 1947-1948, Czechoslovakia ap-
Plied to International Emergency Food Council for an allotment of 1,075 thousand
metric tons of grain. After screening by the Cereal Committee, Czechoslovakia’s allot-
ment was placed at 420 thousand metric tons composed of 320 thousand tons of wheat
and rye (including flour in terms of grain), and 100 thousand tons of coarse grains.

During the six months 1 July to 31 December 1947, shipments and programs for
shipment of wheat and rye (including flour in terms of grain) totaled 57.7 thousand
metric tons and 30 thousand metric tons of coarse grains. Six thousand long tons
(in lieu of metric tons) of wheat were shipped from the United States and 2,700 long
tons from Canada, indicating that 49 thousand metric tons of bread grains and 30
thousand metric tons of coarse grains were received from other sources.

It is reported that Czechoslovakia has obtained commitments from the Soviet
Union for the shipment of 400 thousand metric tons of bread grains and’ 200 thousand
metric tons of coarse grains. Of these quantities, 50 thousand tons of bread grains and
50 thousand tons of coarse grains are reported to have been shipped or were to be
shipped by 31 December 1947,

If 49 (50) thousand tons of bread grains and 30 thousand tons of coarse grains
of the Soviet Union’s commitment have been shipped to Czechoslovakia, then there
remain 350 to 351 thousand tons of bread grains and 150 to 170 thousand metric tons
Of coarse grains to be shipped during the first six to seven months of 1948. This
quantity of 500 to 521 thousand tons, if shipped, will probably have to be transported
by rail through Poland or by barge up the Danube River. Doubt has been expressed
as to the possibility of the Soviet government being able to ship such a quantity of
grain (equivalent to more than 50,000 car loads of 10 tons per car) during the next
few months over the single-track railroad through Southern Poland to a transfer point
near the frontier of Czechoslovakia. Shipment by barge up the Danube would be
still more difficult. There are reports that Czechoslovakia is to receive up to 30 thou-
sand metric tons of grain from Argentina.

4. Huncary.

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Hungary, with an aver-
age production of total grain of 5,999 thousand metric tons, exported 625 thousand
metric tons or 10.4 percent of its indigenous production of bread and coarse grains,
but imported 19 thousand tons of rice. This indicates an average total domestic
supply of 5,393 thousand metric tons.

Hungary was 125 percent self-sufficient in bread grains, 101.3 percent self-suffi-
cient in coarse grains, but 100 percent deficient in rice.

Exports during this period averaged 585 thousand metric tons of bread grains
(chiefly wheat) and 40 thousand metric tons of coarse grains.

The 1947 total production of Hungary was placed at 4,145 thousand tons which,
although 604 thousand metric tons (17 percent) above the 1946 production of 3,541

  

”
conrifrrsa 30
Page-37
thousand metric tons, was still 37 percent below the average production of 6,543
thousand metric tons during the five-year period 1935-1939, and 1,248 thousand metric
tons (23 percent) below the 1933-1934 through 1937-1938 average domestic supply.

There are reports that, in spite of an obvious shortage in supply of bread grains,
Hungary is to pay the Soviet Union 100 thousand metric tons of wheat which will be
shipped to Czechoslovakia for the account of the Soviet Union.

It has been reported that, in addition to wheat, Hungary would ship 30 thousand
metric tons of coarse grain to Czechoslovakia.

5. Rumania.

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Rumania, with an aver-
age production of total grains of 8,235 thousand metric tons, exported 1,026 thousand
metric tons or 12.4 percent of its indigenous production of bread and coarse grains,
but imported 15 thousand metric tons of rice. This indicates an average total domestic
supply of 7,224 thousand metric tons.

Rumania was 116 percent self-sufficient in bread grains and 114 percent in coarse
grains, but 100 percent deficient in rice.

Exports during this period averaged 360 thousand metric tons of bread grains and
666 thousand metric tons of coarse grains per year.

The 1947 production of grain in Rumania was estimated at 7,349 thousand metric
tons which although 2,958 thousand tons (69.6 percent) (for the most part corn) above
the poor production of 1946 placed at 4,391 thousand tons, was still 1,546 thousand tons
(17.4 percent) below the average production during the five-year period 1935-1939
of 8,895 thousand metric tons, but 125 thousand metric tons (1.7 percent) greater than
the 1933-1934 through 1937-1938 average domestic supply.

Rumania received during the last six months of 1947, 3,500 long tons of bread
grains and 52 thousand long tons of corn from the United States as well as 6,100 metric
tons of coarse grains from Argentina. These shipments were probably made to cover
Rumania’s most urgent pre-harvest requirements.

It is further reported that the Soviet Union shipped Rumania 60 thousand metric
tons of wheat and 22 thousand tons of barley from the 1947 production.

Recent reports indicate that Rumania may have 1,200 thousand metric tons of
corn available for export

 

6 YUGOSLAVIA

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Yugoslavia, with an
average production of total grain of 7,842 thousand metric tons, exported 645 thousand
metric tons, or 7.3 percent of its indigenous production of bread and coarse grains, but
imported 15 thousand metric tons of rice. This indicates an average total domestic
supply of 7,212 thousand metric tons

Yugoslavia was 107 percent self-sufficient in bread grains, 109 percent self-suffi-
cient in coarse grains, but was 88 percent deficient in rice.

Exports during this period averaged 158 thousand metric tons of bread grains
and 487 thousand metric tons of coarse grains (chiefly corn) per year.

*

31 connafherras
Page-38
‘The 1947 grain production of Yugoslavia was estimated at 7,492 thousand metric
tons which (chiefly because of a large corn production) was 2,122 thousand tons
(39.5 percent) greater than the 5,370 thousand tons produced in 1946. The 1947
production was still 8.4 percent below 1935-1939 prewar average of 8,182 thousand
metric tons, and 280 thousand metric tons greater than the 1933-1934 through 1937-
1938 average domestic supply.

Since a large percentage of the South Slavs eat bread made from corn meal,
Yugoslavia is the only country among the Satellite group that has not to date indicated
a need for grain imports. On the other hand, it is rumored that Yugoslavia may
offer grain, particularly corn, for export.

There are reports that Yugoslavia will ship grain (probably corn) to Italy and
Belgium.

7. Burearia.

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Bulgaria, with an aver-
age production of total cereals of 3,130 thousand metric tons, exported 202 thousand
metric tons or 6.5 percent of its indigenous production of bread and coarse grains and
Tice. This indicates an average total domestic supply of 2,928 thousand metric tons.

Exports during this period averaged 105 thousand metric tons of bread grains,
96 thousand metric tons of coarse grains, and 1 thousand metric tons of rice.

The 1947 grain production of Bulgaria was estimated at 2,524 thousand metric
tons which was 492 thousand tons (16.3 percent) less than the 3,016 thousand tons
produced in 1946 and 24.4 percent below the average production of 3,340 thousand
tons during the five-year period 1935-1939. The 1947 production was 404 thousand
metric tons below the 1933-1934 through 1937-1938 average domestic supply.

The drought of 1947 adversely affected the production of small grains rather than
corn, the production of which exceeded that of 1946. Following the harvest of 1947,
wheat was doubtless in short supply and an appeal was made to Moscow. The Soviet
Union shipped to Bulgaria 20 thousand metric tons of wheat and 5 thousand metric tons
of barley which was evidently a gesture. Unless bread grain is shipped in the spring,
the Bulgarian people, who are essentially wheat eaters, will have to substitute corn for
wheat in the bread mixture or go on short rations.

It has been reported that Bulgaria will ship corn valued at $780,000.00 (possibly
10 thousand metric tons) to Italy.

A recent report indicated that the Soviet Union will ship an additional 75 thou-
sand metric tons of wheat to Bulgaria. This may have a military significance.

8. ALBANIA.

During the five-year period 1933-1934 through 1937-1938, Albania with an aver-
age production of 193 thousand metric tons imported 16.1 percent of its grain re-
quirement of 230 thousand metric tons.

Indigenous production supplied 58 percent of the bread grains, 100 percent of the
coarse grains, but none of the rice used domestically. Imports during this period

consfesriat 32
Page-39
confront

averaged 35 thousand metric tons of bread grains (wheat) and 2 thousand metric tons
of rice.

The 1947 production of grain in Albania is estimated at 211 thousand metric tons
or 26 thousand tons (11.0 percent) below the. 1946 production of 237 thousand tons.
The 1947 production was 11.1 percent above the average production during 1935-1939
of 190 thousand tons, but only 11 thousand metric tons below the 1933-1934 through
1937-1938 average domestic requirement.

Although the 1947 production of Albania was less than the normal prewar require-
ments, it is improbable that grain for civilian consumption will be imported during the
consumption year 1947-1948, but there is the strong probability that grain to supply
the requirements of Albanian or other military forces will be shipped through Yugo-
slavian ports to Tirana.

APPENDIX IV

THE RELATIONSHIP OF GRAIN PRODUCTION TO TOTAL POPULATION

In analyzing the food position of a particular country or area, it is conventional
to relate current production or expectancy for any given period to prewar production.
If the population of the area concerned is changing, as is true of all the areas included
in this analysis (see Table R, Appendix V), it is necessary to relate production to
population in order to obtain more accurate relationships.

In this analysis the five-year period’ 1935-1936 through 1939-1940 has been used
as a prewar base and the production per capita given an arbitrary value of 100. Esti-
mated production per capita for subsequent years has been computed and expressed
as a percentage of production per capita during the 1935-1939 base period. These re-
lationships for each country included in this report expressed in terms of bread grains,
coarse grains, and total grains including rice are summarized in the following tables:

TABLE O.—BREAD GRAIN’ PRODUCTION PER CAPITA. Estimates for 1946 and 1947 and Expect-
ancy for 1950, 1955, and 1960 Expressed in Kilograms Per Person Per Year

APPENDIX V

POPULATION ESTIMATES OF SELECTED COUNTRIES
(PRESENT BOUNDARIES)

Population estimates for the countries included in this analysis were computed
in.consultation with the Population and Labor Branch, Division of International and
Functional Intelligence of the State Department. These estimates, as shown in Table
R, are for the periods 1937, 1946, 1950, 1955, and 1960.

In view of the unsettled economic, social, and political situations in all of these
areas, population estimates for the present and even more so for the future are subject
to a wide margin of error. Estimates for future periods are based on the assumption
that rates of population growth will continue at approximately the same rates that pre-
vailed before the war. It is thus assumed that the postwar boom in births in certain
countries (e.g. Finland and Czechoslovakia) will not continue. At the same time, the
figures make no allowance for long-run downward trends in fertility. It is assumed
that in the Satellite Countries, as in the Soviet Union, the Communist regimes will
endeavor to increase the population through policies which favor large families and
that these policies will offset declines in birth rates which would otherwise be expected
to occur.

The population for 1937 has been used to represent the average population for the
five-year prewar period 1935-1939.

ADDENDUM

The production estimates included in this report for 1947 were based on infor-
mation available as of 15 November 1947. More recent information on the 1947
bread grain harvest in Poland indicates an increase of 640 thousand metric tons of
rye and 150 thousand metric tons of wheat more than is shown in the summary tables.
Revised estimates of the 1947 grain harvest in other countries show some variations
from the 15 November estimates. However, most of the changes are relatively in-
significant.

The data on 1947-48 grain export commitments of the Soviet Union included in
this report were based on information available as of 1 January 1948. Since 1 January
1948 the Soviet Union has made further grain export commitments involving ap-
proximately 1.0 million metric tons. A summary of these commitments as of 4
March 1948 is given below.
