SOVIET CONTROL OF THE EUROPEAN SATELLITES AND THEIR
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOVIET
POWER, THROUGH MID-1953

THE PROBLEM

To estimate the effectiveness of Soviet control over the European Satellites and
their economic and military contributions to Soviet strength, through mid-1953.

ASSUMPTION

That there will not be general war within the period of this estimate.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Soviet control over the Satellites is vir-
, tually complete, assuring for the period of
J this estimate the subservience and relia-
bility of these states and continued eco-
nomic and military benefit to the USSR.

2. A rapid collectivization of agriculture
would almost certainly provoke strong re-
sistance and adversely affect agricultural
production in the Satellites for some time,
v but it would probably not shake Soviet
control over the Satellites. However,
rap’. rollectivization is unlikely to be un-
dertaken within the period of this esti-
mate.

3. The Satellite area is being industrial-
ized and integrated into the Soviet eco-
nomic system. The Satellites supply to
the USSR large, and in some cases critical
quantities of raw materials and industrial
goods, notably uranium ores and concen-
trates, petroleum products, industrial
chemicals, and engineering equipment.

The productive capabilities of the Satel-
lites constitute an important addition to
Soviet economic capabilities and war po-
tential. This increment will become even
more significant as production increases
and as more complete integration with
the USSR is attained.

4. Satellite exports to the West have pro-
vided the Soviet-Satellite complex with
channels for acquiring critical materials
and equipment difficult and in‘some cases
even impossible for the USSR to obtain
directly. The present dependence of some
Western states upon the Satellites for
coal and grains and the reluctance of
some states to forego the advantages of
East-West trade prevent Western export
restrictions from eliminating this advan-
tage entirely.

5. The rising curve of Satellite industrial
production began to flatten out in the first
half of 1951. Increases in industrial pro-

Perse RES— 1
Page-6
duction through 1953 will be limited by
def’ iencies in skilled labor and competent
mat.agement, in raw materials, and in
capital equipment.

6. The industrial capacity and general
economic strength of the Satellites will
remain low in comparison with those of
Western Europe. However, the Satellites
almost certainly will continue to devote
a larger proportion of their productive
capabilities and economic resources to in-
dustrial development and to the produc-
tion of military equipment.

7. The Satellite ground forces are now
estimated to number 947,000 men, organ-
ized into 66 divisions, of which 4 are
armored and 6 mechanized. The forces
have grown in size 49 percent from Janu-
ary 1950 through September 1951. We
believe they will increase by mid-1953 to
a strength of 1,475,000 men, organized
into 116 divisions.

8. The Satellite Air Forces have only
limited defensive and ground attack capa-
bilities. The reorganization of these
forces, now in progress, does not appear
to have a high priority and is unlikely to
be completed within the period of this
estimate. However, a program reflecting
a greater sense of urgency could produce
effective air forces by mid-1953.

—FOR—-SECREF—

9. The Satellite Naval Forces, now .of
negligible significance, are being de-
veloped gradually and by mid-1953 will
probably have the capability of providing
appreciable assistance to the Soviet Navy
in coastal operations.

10. Deficiencies in equipment, and the
unreliability and poor morale of the Satel-
lite armed forces indicate that their esti-
mated size is not an accurate gauge of
their power. However, they are already
a significant factor in the European bal-
ance of forces.. If they advance along the
lines projected by the Kremlin, they will
form a substantial addition to Soviet mili-
tary strength in Europe and will offset,
at least in part, the growth of Western
strength in Europe.

11. Control of the Satellites has pushed
the frontiers of the USSR roughly 500
miles west into Central Europe and has
established for the USSR a buffer zone
now garrisoned by the Satellite forces and
an estimated 455,500 Soviet troops. This
area provides advanced air bases, space
for a forward air defense system, and
naval bases. /Soviet control of the area
constitutes a poised threat to all of West-

ern Europe, the Scandinavian peninsula,
and the Near East. J

DISCUSSION

Control
Degree of Control

12. Soviet control over the Satellites is virtu-
ally complete. It ensures the subservience
- 4d reliability of the governments and con-
1. wed Soviet economic and military benefit
from the area.

13. The Kremlin has maintained and will en-
large its authority over the Satellites through

political, economic, and ideological means and
through the skillful and experienced use of
police and military power.

a. The Kremlin has already decapitated and
pulverized the old political parties and oppo-
sition groups, but the discontent now current
in each Satellite will persist and perhaps in-
crease.

b. The elimination of all but trusted
Stalinists from the Communist hierarchies

2 Porshe
Page-7
—POPr-sBerer

has been almost completed. “Cleansing” of
Communist regimes, however, is a perpetual
process, and there will continue to be purges
within the Communist parties, governments,
armies, and police forces of each of the Satel-
lites.

ce. The subservience of the Satellites will be
guaranteed by present Soviet authority, the
power of Soviet advisers and missions in the
Satellite governments, Soviet economic and
military controls, the rigorous training and
education programs, and calculated use of
terror to create the sense of isolation, ho
lessness, and physical and moral fear. ~

  

Instruments and Techniques

14. Nationalization and direct operation by
the governments of the vital industrial and
commercial sectors of the Satellite economies
simplify Soviet control. Soviet authority over
these economies is exercised in addition
through reparations arrangements, trade and
financial agreements to implement specific
production schedules, the use of Soviet ad-
visers in key positions throughout the econ-
omy, joint companies (notably in Rumania
and Hungary), and the Council of Economic
Mutual Assistance (CEMA), which functions
both as an effective control instrument and
as a facade for “joint planning.”

15. Direct controls are exercised through the
Communist parties. In addition, the Krem-
lin uses the Cominform to further coopera-
tion among the Satellites and to help estab-
lish a uniform political and propaganda line.
Although the Kremlin permits and encourages
programs of cultural, economic, and technical
collaboration among the Satellites, it appears
determined to bind the Satellites individually
to the USSR, rather than to unify them.

16. The secret police and security forces in
each of the Satellites are large, carefully selec-
ted, and well trained. They are infiltrated
and often dominated by experienced Soviet
personnel.

17. Large Soviet military missions are super-
vising the reorganization of the Satellite
armed forces, which are adopting standard
Soviet methods, doctrine, organization, and
equipment. Soviet commanders, advisers,

and technicians are located in key positions
in the military forces and defense ministries,
in effect adding the Satellite forces to_the So-
viet. The purging of the officer corps has
been almost completed, Political indoctrina-
tion often occupies as much time and effort as
military training, and the Satellite forces will
remain dependent upon the USSR for all of
their aircraft and for most of their tanks and
heavy artillery.

18. The final lever of Soviet control consists
of the Soviet forces stationed within these
countries or along their borders. The forces
stationed within the Satellites and in the So-
viet Zone of Austria were estimated in Sep-
tember 1951 to consist of 455,500 from the
Soviet Army (including military missions),
29,000 security troops, and 2,600 Soviet-
manned aircraft.*

Troublesome Issues and Forces

19. A number of issues and forces remain
which will constitute irritations for the Krem-
lin in Eastern Europe, but which will not
jeopardize Soviet authority. Six of these—
nationalism, the traditional hatred of Russia
(except in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria), a
western cultural tradition (especially in Po-
Jand, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary), religion,
territorial conflicts among the Satellites, and
ethnic or religious minorities within the Satel-
lites—derive from the history of this area.
Three—the imposition of the Soviet syStem,
Soviet economic exploitation of the area, and
the current decline of the standard of living—
are direct products of the recent changes.
The Kremlin in the past has shown such skill
and resolution in coping with the unrest re-
sulting from these issues and in discovering
and obliterating hostile forces that, in time
of peace, none of these issues is expected to
develop into more than a nuisance or an im-
pediment upon the Communist program
within the period of this estimate.

20. A rapid collectivization of agriculture
would almost certainly provoke strong resis-
tance and adversely affect agricultural pro-
duction in the Satellites for some time, but

* For further detail concerning Soviet forces sta-
tioned within the Satellites, see Appendix A.

POP—-sEoRES— 3
Page-8
POP-sHeRER—

it would probably not shake Soviet control
over the Satellites. Although collectivization
is fundamental to Stalinist philosophy, it has
been proceeding very slowly in the Satellites
and the rate is not likely to be increased
sharply during the period of this estimate.

ll. Satellite Contributions to Soviet

Strength: Economic
The Long-Term Program

21. During the first years after the conclusion
of hostilities, the USSR ruthlessly extracted
from Eastern Europe the immediately obtain-
able economic benefits. The means used in-
cluded outright requisition’ of materials and
equipment and the imposition of bilateral
trade pacts on terms overwhelmingly advan-
tageous to the USSR.

22. A revised program began to take form late
in 1948, providing for’ the carefully planned
industrialization of the Satellite countries
and their integration into the Soviet economic
system to achieve the following results:

a. Control of these countries and of their
economic development by the USSR and the
creation of Soviet-type socialized economies.

b. Maximum Satellite contribution of their
present resources and production to Soviet
economic and military strength and the re-
organization of the Satellite economies so
that they will become a permanent, constantly
more valuable addition to Soviet strength.

ec. Economic dependence of the Satellites
upon the USSR and their independence from
the West, depriving the West of the economic
advantages it formerly enjoyed in Eastern
Europe.

«. Development of Satellite strength so that
the Satellites, or a group of them, may have
the capability of conducting Soviet-sponsored
localized war and so that the Satellites may
make their maximum contribution to Soviet
strength in a general war.

23. This long-range program has been de-
signed in such a way that the industrial base
and immediate military capabilities of the
area should advance simultaneously. How-
ever, while the Satellites are in a progressively
advancing state of war-readiness, there is no

indication that the program envisages the
outbreak of war at any particular time, or
that the long-term program is being sacrificed
to achieve greater immediate war-readiness.

24, The reorganization of the economies of the
Satellites is directed by the Kremlin through
such agencies as the Council of Economic Mu-
tual Assistance, which provides machinery for
integrating each national economy with that
of the USSR, for allocating raw materials,
capital equipment, and foreign exchange, and
for arranging specialization and division of
labor. The Satellites import from the USSR
some of the raw materials and capital goods
necessary for industrialization, but the in-
dustries developed are those which can con-
tribute most to the economic potential of the
USSR. The Satellites have thus been forced
into a pattern of production and trade sub-
servient to the interests of the USSR.

The Current Plans

25. A high percentage of Satellite national in-
come, unprecedented for this area, is being
devoted to investment, a large proportion of
which, in turn, is scheduled for the expansion
of industrial capacity, particularly in heavy
industry. For example, forty percent of
Czechoslovakia’s capital investment for 1949-
1953 is scheduled for industry, and the planned
Eastern German annual percentage rises from
51 to 55 from 1951 through 1955. .

26. While it is likely that few of the produc-
tion goals set by the plans will be achieved,
these goals are significant in that they indi-
cate the revolutionary character of the
changes planned and the consequent increas-
ing size of the contributions the Kremlin ex-
pects each to make to Soviet strength. For
example, the present plan provides for an in-
crease of industrial production in Poland in
1955 of 58 percent over that of 1949. Sixty
percent of the national income of Poland is
to be derived from industry in 1955, compared
with 49 percent in 1949. In Hungary, the
share of the national income derived from in-
dustry is scheduled to rise from 51 percent in
1949 to 64 percent in 1954. Industrial pro-
duction in 1953 in Czechoslovakia is to be
50 percent greater than that of 1949, and

4 —Foer-srernans
Page-9
heavy industrial production in 1955 is planned
to be 231 percent greater than that of 1948.
Present plans schedule Eastern Germany’s
in. astrial production in 1955 as 190 percent
of that of 1950.

Principal Economic Contributions

27. The principal economic contributions of
the Satellites to the USSR consist of the in-
creasing flow of certain raw materials and of
fabricated products.* The following are the
most important:

a. The Satellites in 1950 are estimated to
have supplied approximately 67 percent of
the Soviet Orbit’s uranium ores and concen-
trates, with Eastern Germany accounting for
45 percent, Czechoslovakia 15 percent, Bul-
garia 4 percent, and Poland 3 percent.

b. Eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hun-
gary, and Poland export to the USSR approxi-
mately 50 percent of the total annual produc-
tion of their engineering industries, or an
amount equal to about 25 percent of Soviet
annual production. Some items, notably
electronic equipment, electric motors, diesel
engines, industrial instruments, and machine
tools, constitute a particularly important con-
tribution to Soviet industrial and military ex-
pansion because of the highly skilled labor in-
volved in their manufacture. In addition,
Eastern German and Czechoslovakian exports
of industrial equipment to other Satellites in-
crease the capacity of those countries for
supplying the USSR.

c. Over 50 percent of the petroleum prod-
ucts produced from crude and synthetics by
the Satellites (including the Soviet Zone of
Austria) is furnished the USSR, primarily for
stockpiling and the supply of Soviet forces
w thin the Satellite area. In 1950, about 4.1
siillion tons of petroleum products refined
from crude and synthetics were made avail-
able to the USSR by the Satellites, compared
with Soviet production of 34 million tons. A
larger amount is being provided in 1951.

 

The table in Appendix B indicates the produc-
tion in 1950 of various selected raw materials
and manufactured equipment by the Satellites,
compared with the production of those mate-
rials and products by the USSR.

FOP-SHECRES

- a. The chemical industries in the Satellite
area make an important direct contribution
to the Soviet war potential, with Eastern Ger-
many and the Polish coke-chemical industry
providing the largest shares. The chemicals
of which Satellite production is most signifi-
cant in relation to Soviet output include syn-
thetic ammonia (71 percent of the USSR’s pro-
duction); nitric acid (32 percent); and sul-
phuric acid (34 percent). The Satellites ex-
port to the USSR substantial quantities of the
chemicals used directly in the Soviet manu-
facture of explosives.

28. The scientific and technical personnel of
Eastern Germany and Czechoslovakia, and to
a lesser extent of Poland and Hungary, con-
stitute a major addition to Soviet capabilities.
Although relatively few of these scientists and
technicians have been moved to the USSR, the
products of their skill are of great value to the
Soviet economy.

29. The Satellites serve as media for obtain-
ing from the West and from the Far East ma-
terials and equipment which are important
to the Soviet war potential and which the
USSR finds difficult and in some cases impos-
sible to obtain directly. These materials and
this equipment, through trade agreements
concluded by the Satellites with the West, are
obtained by the USSR for its own industries
and for Satellite industries working for the
USSR. This asset is diminishing due to West-
ern controls over the export of strategic com-
modities. However, the present, dependence
of some Western European states upon the
Satellites for coal and grains and the reluc-
tance of some states to forego the advantages
of East-West trade prevent Western export re-
strictions from eliminating this advantage en-
tirely.

Limitations on Satellite Economic Capabilities

30. The industrialization programs in effect in
the Satellites since 1948 or earlier encountered
difficulties in 1951 primarily because of the in-
ability of the Satellites to obtain the necessary
supplies of materials and equipment. The
rising curve of industrial production has al-
ready begun to flatten out, and future planned
increases are unlikely to be achieved because

-FPorsrcrec— 5
Page-10
| pep sHeREe—

of shortages. It is almost certain that none
of the Satellites will fulfill the 1951 produc-
4son and export schedules, and full success in
« @ plans is virtually impossible.

31. Current Satellite deficiencies constitute
an important limiting factor on Soviet plans
for the Satellites.

a, The planned expansion of industry far
exceeds the supply of available skilled labor
and management and estimated ability to
train skilled workers, technicians, and man-
“agers.

b. The Satellites lack adequate supplies of
many of the raw materials necessary for the
development of a modern industrial economy.
High-grade iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, nickel,
chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, rubber,
sulphur and pyrites, and tin are extremely
limited in supply. It is unlikely that coal
production could be increased sufficiently to
support the expanded industrial economy of
the Orbit and at the same time to continue
exports to the West at the present level.

c. Deficiencies in capital equipment also
hamper the program. For example, the
presently planned hydroelectric projects re-
quire equipment which neither the USSR nor
the Satellites themselves can provide in suffi-
cient quantity and which cannot now be ob-
tained from the West. Petroleum exploration
and drilling equipment, complex automatic
machine tools, precision instruments, and
machinery for manufacturing anti-friction
bearings are all vital for fulfillment of the
Soviet program for expanded production, and
all are now difficult to obtain.

d. The supply of -agricultural products
available for financing the purchase of ma-
chinery abroad is unlikely to be increased sig-
nificantly beyond its present level.

e. The critical materials and equipment
needed for industrialization of the Satellites
are also now in short supply within the USSR
itself.

Comparison of the Satellites
and Western Europe

32. The productive capabilities and economic
resources of Satellite Europe are low in com-
parison with those of Western Europe. The
total of the national incomes of the Western

European states (including West Germany
and the UK) is at least three times as great
as that of the Satellites, and the estimated
rate of growth of the Satellite economy
through mid-1953 is about the same as the
estimated rate of growth of the Western Euro-
pean economy. The Satellites will almost
certainly continue to devote a higher propor-
tion of their national incomes to military pro-
duction.

Ill. Satellite Contributions to Soviet

Strength: Military
Advanced Bases for the USSR

33. Control of the Satellites has pushed the
frontiers of the USSR roughly 500 miles west
into Central Europe and has established for
the USSR a buffer zone now garrisoned by an
estimated 455,500 Soviet troops, organized
into 30 divisions, and 947,000 Satellite troops.*
This area provides advanced air bases, space
for a forward air defense system, and naval
pases. Soviet control of the area constitutes
a poised threat to all of Western’ Europe, the
Scandinavian peninsula, and the Near East.

34. The bulk of the Soviet forces in the Satel-
lite area is concentrated in Eastern Germany
and constitutes the spearhead of Soviet mili-
tary strength. Soviet-manned aircraft based
in the Satellites now total 2,600, of which 990
are jet fighters, 400 conventional fighters, 540
light bombers, 460 attack bombers, 110 trans-
ports, and 100 reconnaissance planes. The
largest concentration of these craft is in East-
ern Germany, which has 1,330 while Hungary
and the Soviet Zone of Austria together have
570, Poland 480, and Rumania 220. There
has been no significant increase in the size of
these forces during the past two years, but jet
fighters are gradually replacing conventional
ones and jet light bombers have begun to ap-
pear.

Satellite Ground Forces

35. The ground forces of the Satellites are now
estimated at 947,000 men, and the internal se-
curity forces constitute an additional 204,500

* Allied divisions are approximately 80 percent
larger than Soviet and Satellite divisions, both
in T/O and in present numerical strength.

6 —FOn--fECREE—

—POP-sH6RES—

men.’ These ground forces are now organ-
irr into 66 divisions, of which 4 are armored
anu 6 mechanized. These forces increased in
size approximately 49 percent from January
1950 through September 1951. They are
growing in strength and quality at an acceler-
ated rate, and it is believed that they will in-
crease an additional 55 percent in size by mid-
1953. At that date, they will total an esti-
mated 1,475,000, or 116 divisions, of which 11
will be armored and 18 mechanized.

36. The Kremlin is reorganizing the Satellite
ground forces so that they will conform to the
Soviet pattern. Great differences still exist
among the Satellite forces in training, equip-
ment, morale, and general capabilities. The
Bulgarian army is apparently the most loyal
and formidable, although even it is not yet a
completely reliable Soviet instrument. Its 13
divisions are almost fully equipped with Soviet
materiel, reserve stockpiles are available, and
morale is good. There are approximately
450,000 trained reserves, of whom about 180,-
000 are sufficiently trained for immediate com-
bat.

37. No other Satellite force will attain the
present capabilities of the Bulgarian army be-
fore the end of 1952. The Rumanian and
Hungarian ground forces most closely ap-
proach the Bulgarian standard, but even these
armies lack standardized equipment and train-
ing and are not considered completely reliable.
Only 20 percent of Rumanian equipment, for
example, is of Soviet manufacture. The
ground forces of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and
Eastern Germany are much less advanced and
reliable than the Balkan armies, and the USSR.
couldnc. .ow rely upon them in a general war
except for subsidiary duties.

38. Within the period of this estimate, the
Kremlin is likely to be uncertain of the loyal
support of the Polish, Czechoslovakian, and
Eastern German ground forces. While the
ground forces of the other Satellites are now
more reliable, the loyalty of even these armies
may be severely shaken if the present disparity
in military power of the West and the Orbit is

of Satellite ground forces, 1951-1953, see Appen-
dix C.

substantially reduced or if the USSR should
suffer reverses in a general war.

39. The Satellite forces are not now fully co-
ordinated. However, the command structures
and the Soviet role are such that coordination
can almost certainly be achieved within the
period of this estimate.

40. The Kremlin has inaugurated a program
for standardizing the equipment of the Satel-
lite ground forces. The Satellites are now
manufacturing for their own use light-ar-
mored and non-combat vehicles, light artillery,
small arms, ammunition, and parts. They
are dependent upon the USSR for most of
their tanks, self-propelled guns, and heavy ar-
tillery, and for some of their light artillery
and small arms.

41. As Appendix C indicates, trained or par-
tially trained reserves of the Satellite ground
forces amount to approximately 5,075,000 men.
This figure is deceptive, however, because:

a. Few of these men have had recent train-
ing or have used Soviet equipment, which will
become standard in all of these armies, and
few have been subject to the degree of indoc-
trination sought by the Kremlin in the armed
forces.

b. The industrialization and militarization
programs are causing increasing manpower
dislocations, especially in the Satellites most
advanced industrially.

c. There is little equipment available for
reserves, except in Bulgaria and except for the
equipment and stockpiles of Soviet forces now
stationed in Eastern Europe. Even the pres-
ent Bulgarian army lacks adequate signal and
engineer equipment.

Satellite Air Forces and Airfields

42. The mission of the Satellite Air Forces is
primarily defensive. These air forces possess
approximately 2,450 aircraft, and there are
probably only 3,000 trained pilots. available.’
The Kremlin is now engaged in an increas-
ingly rapid development of these forces, con-
centrating at first upon Poland and Hungary.
Equipment and aircraft are now practically all

Forces, see Appendix D.

of World War II design and construction, but
j‘t fighters are appearing in increasing num-
vw. 's and intensive Soviet training of carefully
selected Satellite pilots is assuring Soviet con-
trol, doctrines, techniques, and tactics. The
Czechoslovakian and Rumanian air forces are

“now being completely reorganized and re-
built, but these forces will probably not be re-
liable and. efficient within the period of this
estimate.

43. An extensive program of air field improve-
ment and construction is being carried out in
all of the Satellites except Albania. There are
now 323 airfields in the Satellite area; 65 of
these have runways capable of sustained heavy
and medium-bomber operations. The empha-
sis is upon Eastern Germany, where 7 fields
can now support sustained, and 13 limited,
operations by heavy bombers, medium bomb-
ers, and jet fighters, and where 21 other fields
are being improved. The Eastern German
network is the best equipped in the Satellites
and provides the most extensive and up-to-
date facilities for night-flying and all-weather
operations. This network and the Hungarian
network already surpass present needs for the
aircraft types currently based in those coun-
tries.

44. The Soviet forces stationed in the Satellites
are supplied with antiaircraft equipment, but
intensive development for the Satellites of
early warning radar networks, radar-con-
trolled antiaircraft, and civil defense began
only in the spring of 1951. Progress has been

most notable in Poland, Rumania, and Hun-
gary. Even now, the Satellites possess only
small amounts of World War II radar equip-
ment, and spotters are still employed to Teport,
aircraft movement. None of the Satellites has
trained a modern and effective antiaircraft
command.

Satellite Naval Forces

45. The capabilities of the Satellite navies are
currently negligible, and the personnel of these
navies is not yet considered completely reli-
able. Soviet control is being improved through
the placing of Soviet naval officers in the com-
mand structures, the elimination of all whose
loyalty is suspect, and intensive political in-
doctrination courses. Small numbers of So-
viet ships, notably of mine and escort types,
have been turned over to the Satellite navies.
By mid-1953, the Satellite navies will probably
be able to provide appreciable assistance to the
Soviet navy in such fields as minesweeping,
minelaying, escort, and coastal defense duties.

Summary

46. In summary, because of deficiencies in
equipment, loyalty, and morale, the Satellite
armed forces as such do not now possess the
capabilities which their size would appear to
indicate. However, they are already a sig-
nificant factor in the European balance of
forces. If they advance along the lines pro-
jected by the Kremlin, they will form a sub-
stantial addition to Soviet military strength in
Europe and will offset, at least in part, the
growth of Western strength.
