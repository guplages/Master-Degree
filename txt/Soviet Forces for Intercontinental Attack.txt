COST OF ILLUSTRATIVE SOVIET FORCE’ MODELS

Costing Methodology

1. Estimates of Soviet spending for each
of the illustrative force projections shown in
the Appendix to Section XII were developed
on the basis of a methodology utilizing direct
costing. This approach begins with a detailed
statement of the forces. These forces are then
multiplied by estimates of what they would
cost both in rubles and in dollars. Finally,
the results are summed into totals and sub-
totals using expenditure categories similar to
those used by the US Department of Defense.

2. Available intelligence information has
made it possible to develop a large data base
for the costing process. The costing of pro-
jected force levels utilizes our understanding
of past Soviet deployment practices, informa-
tion on rates of production, manning levels,
and operating procedures. In most cases the
cost data used are based on US analogs, but

‘The dollar figures are approximations of the cost
of the estimated Soviet program if purchased and
operated in the US.

the costs are always a reflection of our under-
standing of the physical make-up of the So-
viet weapon systems and the Soviet proce-
dures for operating and maintaining them.

3. In effect, the costing process amounts to
building a Soviet military budget for inter-
continental attack systems—line item by line
item—from the base up. The work is done
twice, once in rubles and once in dollars. A
specific ratio of rubles to dollars is used for
each resource input to Soviet military pro-
grams.’ Individual calculations are. necessary
because no single ruble-dollar relationship
can accurately reflect all the different types
of expenditures that make up defense spend-
ing. If the official exchange rate were applied
to the ruble calculation of Soviet defense

*As the mix of the resources used by the Soviets
changes, the ratio of the overall cost expressed in
rubles to that expressed in dollars will also change.
As a result, a ruble expenditure which equates to a
certain dollar expenditure in one year will not neces-
sarily equate to the same dollar expenditure in an-
other year.

spending, for example, it would provide a
grossly understated view of the magnitude of
the Soviet effort. :

4. The estimates made in rubles show how
the costs of individual programs would look
and compare with each other from the point
of view of Soviet defense planners. The rubie
estimates also provide a Soviet view of how
spending for defense programs relates to other
Soviet economic activity—e.g., investment pro-
grams for economic growth and programs
aimed at improving the lot of the consumer.
(See Table I.)

5. The expenditure estimates expressed in
dollars provide an appreciation of the size of
Soviet defense programs in terms that are
familiar to US planners and policy makers,
and they make it possible to compare Soviet
expenditures with those on US programs. (See
Table II.)

6. In the technique of direct costing, esti-
mates are made of both Soviet “investment”
and operating costs. Investment expenditures
include outlays for the procurement of new
weapons and equipment, and for construction
of facilities. Operating expenditures include
outlays for personnel (such as pay and allow-
ances and food) and for operation and main-
tenance (such as spare parts and gasoline).

7. Total Soviet expenditures for military re-
search, development, test, and evaluation
(RDT&E) can only be estimated in the aggre-
gate, based on an analysis of Soviet financial
data. There is not enough information on indi-
vidual Soviet programs to permit direct cost-
ing estimates of the total or of that for
intercontinental attack systems. All of the ex-
penditure estimates presented exclude spend-
ing for military RDT&E.

Expenditure Estimates *

8. Illustrative Force A would cost about
8.2 billion rubles (the equivalent of $21.6
billion) over the period 1970-1975, an average
of about 1.4 billion rubles ($3.6 billion) per
year. The spending pattern for this force
would be one of rapid decline from the highest
point in 1970 to annual expenditure levels
from 1973 on that would provide substantial
savings—about a billion rubles a year—com-
pared with the average level of expenditures
in the previous six years.

9. The three illustrative B forces yield ex-
penditure patterns that are similar to one
another. For the period as a whole, spending
for both Force B-1 and B-2 would average
about 1.8 billion rubles ($4.6 billion) —some-
what less than during the 1964-1969 period—
and spending for Force B-3 would be some-
what higher—2.1 billion rubles ($5.3 billion).
Expenditures for all three models would de-
cline gradually after 1970 so that by 1974, at
the latest, annual expenditures would be below
the average for the 1964-1969 period.

10. The expenditures implied by Illustrative
Forces C and D represent large increases in
spending for intercontinental attack programs.
For the period 1970-1975 as a whole, Force C
would require outlays roughly a third greater
than those of the previous six years. Expendi-
tures would reach a peak in 1973 of 2.8 billion
rubles ($6.4 billion} and would decline there-
after.

* Because expenditures for procurement of equip-
ment and construction of facilities for new weapon
systems usually begin some two or three years before
the systems become. operational andi the forces from
which these figures were derived were projected
only to 1978, the costs of the illustrative forces’ were
projected only through 1975.

~SECRE 3

11. Spending for Illustrative Force D would
amount to about 18 billion rubles ($42 bil-
lion) over the period 1970-1975. Annual out-
lays would increase steadily over time reach-
ing by the mid-1970s levels almost double the
average level of spending in the previous six
years,

Validity of the Estimates of Expenditures

12 The validity of the estimates of expendi-
tures depends on the reliability of the under-
lying cstimates of the size and composition
of the forces being costed, and on the ac-

curacy of the prices. applied to that data. The.

physical data base reflects the combined col-
lection and analytical efforts of the Intelli-
gence Community; its adequacy is discussed
in Part XI of the text and the earlier ‘portion
of Part XII. Many of the cost factors are
necessarily derived only from analogous US
data and experience—but they are probably

reasonably accurate. The expenditure esti-
mates for the historical period are believed
to be accurate as to trend and level. For
Projections, of course, actual force levels as
well as costs of new systems are more un-
certain, and this uncertainty increases as the
time period for the projections is extended.

13. We believe that the ranking of the
illustrative force models according to total
spending levels.is accurate. Similarly, the
projected direction and rate of change in
spending for each of the forces is probably
close to the mark. In general, we are much
less certain about absolute levels of spending
although we are still confident that the esti-
mated spending for any element—eg.,
ICBMs—of a given force projection can be
usefully compared with the estimated spend-
ing on the same element in other illustrative
projections,
