SOVIET POLICIES IN THE
MIDDLE EAST AND
MEDITERRANEAN AREA

SUMMARY

A. Over the last 15 years, the USSR has established itself as a major
power factor in the Mediterranean world, By exploiting postcolonial
resentments and especially the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Soviets have
sought to deny the area to Western interests and influence. Their cal-
culation has been that the displacement of Western with Soviet in-
fluence would constitute a broad strategic reversal for the West and
a considerable gain for themselves. Nevertheless, they have not seen
the area as one which engaged their most vital national interests; these
remain focused on their relations with the US in general, on Eastern
and Central Europe, and on their conflict with Communist China.

B. The Arab-Israeli conflict provides the Soviets with their greatest
means of leverage in the Middle East, but it also faces them with the
most severe complications. They have extended enough military aid
to the radical Arabs to become thoroughly involved in the latters’
cause, but their efforts have not created an effective Arab defense.
Israeli military attacks, particularly against Egypt, intensify this Soviet
dilemma. They wish to provide Egypt with effective defense, but
seek also to minimize the risks of direct involvement; yet if they sought
to defuse the situation by pressing the Arabs to make concessions to
Israel, they would jeopardize their influence in the Arab world, Barring
a de-escalation of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Soviets will probably
step up their aid to the Egyptians, and they may provide new weapons
systems and additional personnel to improve Egyptian air defenses.

C. Despite the Soviet support for the Arab cause in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, Moscow’s relations with the radical Arab states are subject
to occasionally serious strains; none of these countries is entirely re-

Si ET 1

cf

sponsive to Soviet pressures, and each is jealous and suspicious of
the others. The still more uncontrollable fedayeen movement is a
problem for Moscow, chiefly because any direct Soviet support for
it involves embarrassment in Moscow’s relations with established gov-
ernments; nevertheless, we think the Soviets will continue to develop
relations with the fedayeen discreetly.

D. The Soviets have aspirations to establish themselves in the west-
ern Mediterranean as well, but Tunisia and Morocco remain generally
wary of the USSR and retain strong ties with the West. Algeria has
accepted Soviet assistance, but more recently it has been drawing
nearer to its immediate neighbors and to France. Although the new
regime in Libya has close ties with Egypt, it shows no signs of welcom-
ing a Soviet presence, and Nasser is probably not anxious to encourage
Soviet influence there. Among European states with interests in the
area, Moscow must be concerned to avoid provoking alarm by its ac-
tivities in the Mediterranean lest this compromise its policies in West-
ern Europe; France, in particular, has ambitions to enlarge its role in
the Mediterranean.

E. Since the June War in 1967, the Soviet military presence has
&rown in the area: roughly 5,000 Soviet military advisers are now
stationed in several area countries; the Soviet naval squadron in the
Mediterranean has been strengthened, and is supported by air and
port facilities in Egypt. How the USSR might use its military strength
in the Mediterranean area in times of crisis and war is examined in
this paper in four major contingencies: (1) Arab-Israeli hostilities short
of all-out war (paragraphs 41-48); (2) full-scale Arab-Israeli war (para-
graphs 49-51); (3) other disputes in the area in which Soviet interests
were involved (paragraphs 52-53); and (4) East-West hostilities in-
volving both the US and the USSR (paragraphs 54-55),

F. The Soviet presence in the Mediterranean region is likely to
prove durable. Radical nationalist forces will continue to work against
Western interests and will continue to receive Soviet support. Thus
the rivalry between the US and USSR in the area is likely to persist at
least so long as it continues in the world at large.

DISCUSSION

!. THE STRATEGIC SETTING: BROAD SOVIET CONSIDERATIONS AND
OBJECTIVES

L Soviet power first moved into the Meditcrrancan in the mid-1950s. Seizing
on the opportunities for influence offered by Arab-Israeli antagonisms and by
increasingly militant and anti-Western forms of Arab nationalism, and leap-
frogging over the Middle Eastern members of the newly formed Baghdad Pact
(Turkey, Iran, and Iraq), the USSR eased its way into both Cairo and Damascus
with offers of arms, economic aid, and political support. During the 1960s,
through the use of these and other conventional instruments of influence and
power, the USSR became the primary backer of the radical Arab states, Today
the Sovict Union is a major factor in the Middle East, with a number of client
states in varying degrees of dependency and with elements of its own armed
forces now present in the area. The Soviet leadership almost certainly sees
its gains here as the most extensive and successful of all its efforts to expand
Soviet influence in areas of the world once dominated by the West.

2. Clearly, the Soviets have in this period looked upon the Middle East
as an area of strategic importance. A part of this attitude no doubt was in-
herited from their predecessors; Czarist planners traditionally viewed this part
of the world as a special Russian sphere of interest and periodically sought to
expand Russian power southwards. In modern times, especially since the death of
Stalin, this geopolitical emphasis has been accompanied by an ideologically
inspired hope that the anticolonialist attitudes of the Third World could be
made to work for social change and for the emergence of local power elites
sympathetic to communism. And this has been joined with the view that the
Middle East has become one of the main arenas of the Soviet struggle with
the West and the US. The Soviets may see the area as more complicated and
the opportunities less immediate than they did in 1955 when they first under-
took a military supply program for Egypt. But they evidently still hope to
bring the states of the region into an anti-Western alignment and ultimately
to establish their own hegemony there. Finally, the area is seen in Moscow
as a strategic military zone: in hostile hands, it could pose a threat to the USSR
and block Soviet access to the Mediterranean; in friendly hands, it protects
the USSR’s southwestern border and permits Moscow to move its influence
into the Mediterranean world and beyond. The Middle East and much of the
non-European. Mediterranean world are thus, in the Soviet world view, proxi-
mate, important, and vulnerable.

3. This is not to say that the Soviets attach the same weight to their problems
and objectives in the Middle East and Mediterranean basin as they do to their
prime concerns elsewhere. Their stake there is less critical to their interests than
their relations, with the US in general, their concerns in Eastern and Central
Europe, and their conflict with Communist China. It is in these areas and with
these countries that the most vital of Soviet national interests are directly en-

seer

gaged. There are in addition certain self-imposed limitations on Sovict policies
in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East. The preservation of the USSR’s
position in the Middle East would not be worth the serious risk of nuclear war
with the US, whereas its presence in, say, East Germany, might be. But at least
until recently Moscow has been able to base its approach in the Mediterranean
area on calculations of opportunity and risk within the area concerned without
serious conflicts with its objectives elsewhere.

 

4. Inevitably, as the degree of its involvement in the area has grown and
the level of its commitment risen, the .USSR has found itself faced with mount-
ing costs and risks. It has exhibited some anxiety to control these risks and to
curb the excessive enthusiasms of some of its clients. But it has also chosen
to live with danger, and its position is now potentially vulnerable to the pres-
sures and perils of events over which it may have little or no control—the
actions of the Arab states, of Israel, and even of the US. Broadly speaking,
Moscow has behaved as if it wishes the Middle East to remain an area of at
least some tension. It apparently believes that the risks attending this are
manageable, and that continued polarization in the area will make it increas-
ingly difficult for the conservative Arab states to maintain their ties with the
US, thus decreasing US influence throughout the area. But the Soviets clearly
recognize that in the event of another explosion in the Middle East they would
be faced with some very hard choices.

I. INSTRUMENTS OF SOVIET POWER IN THE AREA

5. In moving into the Mediterranean, the Soviets have used the conventional
instruments of power available, short of the actual use of force, to exploit the
opportunities open to them. They have used military and economic assistance
as a means of penetration and as a way of promoting Arab dependence on the
USSR; they have maneuvered politically to pressure and seduce and support;
and they have introduced their own naval power into the area as a means of
adding to their influence and diminishing that of their antagonists,

6. Military Aid. The first and still most important Soviet instrument of in-
fluence is military assistance.’ Since the mid-1950s, the USSR has extended $2.8
billion of such aid to four Arab states—Egypt, Iraq, Syria, and Algeria; this
represents roughly half of all Soviet military aid to non-Communist countries.
Egypt, with over $1.4 billion in aid, is by far the largest beneficiary. Iraq and
Syria have also become almost wholly dependent on the USSR for weapons,
equipment, and spare parts. It was Moscow’s prompt and extensive resupply
operation in the wake of the June War which quickly restored the leverage it
had momentarily lost in the Arab world.

7. Economic Assistance. The USSR has also engaged in substantial economic
aid programs in the Middle East and the Mediterranean area. Since 1957, the

‘See Appendix, Table I.
* See Appendix, Table I.

4 ede
Page-9
she

Soviets have committed at least $2.6 billion of economic aid to Egypt, Iran,
Turkey, Iraq, Algeria, and Syria (in that order )—about 40 percent of their total
economic aid commitments to all non-Communist countries. These programs
serve different policy aims in different countries. In the case of Egypt, for
example, the aim is to assist the development of the leading Arab nation as a
Soviet client, and to reinforce the overall pattern of dependency on the USSR;
with Iran, there is a solid economic basis for expanded relations as well as the
political purpose of helping to loosen Iranian ties with the West. Though in
other areas of the world Moscow is becoming more selective and tough-minded,
the policy of economic assisttnce in the Middle East and the Mediterranean
area is likely to continue on a substantial scale for the foreseeable future.

8. Other Economic Interests. Economic interests play a role in Soviet policy,
but not a decisive one. The Soviets want to maintain access to the waterways
of the area; over half the Soviet merchant marine tonnage is based in Black Sea
ports. Continued closure of the Suez Canal increases the cost of Soviet shipping
east of Africa, but Moscow has learned to live with this situation, however
unhappily. The USSR also has some interest in Middle Eastem oil and gas,
both for itself and for the countries of Eastern Europe. Although Soviet supplies
of petroleum appear adequate for domestic consumption and substantial exports
for many years to come, East European and Soviet imports from the Middle East
would release corresponding quantities of Soviet oil and gas for additional
sales in hard currency markets. But Communist imports are likely to remain
a small proportion of Middle East oil sales, and such imports would be further
limited by the desire of the producing states to sell elsewhere for hard
currencies.

9. The Soviet Military Presence. The Soviets have substantially increased their
military presence in the eastern Mediterranean since the June War. The number
of military advisers attached to Arab forces has been greatly increased and the
Soviet naval squadron has been strengthened. The squadron’s political objectives
apparently are to show the flag, to demonstrate support of the USSR’s allies in
the area, and to reveal to the world that the Mediterranean Sea is no longer
an exclusive preserve of the US Sixth Fleet. Its primary military roles are to
monitor the Sixth Fleet, to complicate and inhibit its operations even in peace
time, to develop capabilities against Polaris submarines and, in the event of
hostilities, to attempt to deny Western naval forces the use of Mediterranean
waters. Currently, the Soviet naval units also seem to have some effect in
deterring Israeli attacks on Egyptian ports.

10. From the few surface ships and submarines deployed in 1964, the Soviet
Mediterranean squadron has since grown to become the largest Soviet naval force
outside home fleet operating areas. Except for occasional peaks, the Soviet squad-
ron usually consists of about 12 surface combatants, 2 or 3 landing ships, and
8 to 10 diesel and nuclear-powered submarines. Normally, between 12 and 15
auxiliary ships provide logistic support and 1 to 3 are intelligence ships. Normally,
2 to 4 of the surface combatants are equipped with surface-to-air or surface-to-
Page-10
fh

surface missiles, and 1 or 2 of the submarines are nuclear-powered. In addition,
6 Soviet naval reconnaissance aircraft (TU-16s), and 3 antisubmarine warfare
(ASW) amphibian aircraft operate from Egyptian air bases in support of the
squadron.

1l. We estimate that the Soviets have roughly 5,000 military advisers sta-
tioned in the area—about 3,000 in Egypt, 1,200 in Algeria, 500 in Syria, a few
hundred in Iraq, and lesser numbers in the Sudan, Yemen, and South Yemen.
Although these advisers are not known to have command authority, in Egypt
and Syria they occupy important advisory positions at or near command levels,
and are present with units down to battalion/squadron level.

12. Since the June War the Soviets have concluded a number of “facilities
arrangements” with Egypt which permit the Soviet naval squadron to make
regular use of repair facilities in Alexandria and of storage facilities there and
in Port Said. We have no evidence of any such approach to Syria. The Soviets
would probably like to have similar facilities in the western Mediterranean.
They apparently sought such arrangements with Algeria, but have been rebuffed.
In fact, the Algerians have recently called for the withdrawal from the Mediter-
ranean of the fleets of all non-riparian powers.

13. Soviet naval units, both surface and submarine, use the Egyptian facilities
throughout the year; both surface vessels and submarines are at times supplied
and repaired by Soviet tenders which remain on station in Alexandria. While
not bases in the conventional sense—the Egyptians evidently retain formal con-
trol—these facilities do provide support services in much the same way. But in
case of a major East-West crisis the availability of these facilities to the Soviets
might be uncertain and would depend to an important degree on the circum.
stances of the crisis.

14. For purposes of refueling and resupply, the Soviet Mediterranean squadron
relies primarily on 12 naval anchorages (mostly in international waters). It uses
Egyptian shore facilities more on a basis of convenience than actual need, though
these do enable it to extend the length of time its diesel submarines remain in
the Mediterranean from two months to six. We believe that the Soviets would be
reluctant to undercut their anti-imperialist propaganda by seeking to establish
bases of their own in Arab lands. And even the radical Arab governments would
want to avoid the stigma of such bases (though Egypt no doubt derives some
comfort from the presence of Soviet naval vessels as deterrents to Israeli action).

Ill. POLICIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST

The Arab-Israeli Conflict

15. The evident damage done to Soviet standing in Arab eyes during the June
War has since béen repaired and the Soviet position strengthened. Moscow has
established itself even more firmly as the champion of the radical Arabs, thus gain-
ing an enlarged presence, a degree of Arab support for Soviet policies elsewhere,

and a major voice in international negotiations concerning the area. The USSR
has achieved this position at a price, not only in terms of the hardware involved
in resupplying the Arabs but also in terms of the strains created by the increas-
ingly critical Arab-Israeli conflict and the USSR’s inability to produce either
an acceptable solution or adequate protection for its clients. But these strains
are not likely to undermine Soviet influence seriously so long as the Arabs have
no alternative sources of great power support against Israel and continue to Te-
gard the US as committed to Israel’s cause. In any case, the patron-client rela-
tionship involves a degree of Arab leverage over the Soviets as well as vice versa.
For, in the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Soviets are more a prisoner of Arab emotions
than the architect of Arab policies.

16. The Soviets have not, however, harnessed themselves to the more extreme
aims of the Arabs toward Israel, and it is unlikely they will do so, Moscow con-
tinues to accept the legitimacy of Israel’s statehood and Soviet diplomatic activity
proceeds from the premise that a negotiated settlement should give Israel security.
Yet the Russians recognize that in order to maintain their position with the Arabs
they must maintain a generally hostile posture vis-a-vis Israel and broadcast
their firm opposition to Israel’s policies.

17. There has clearly been a large element of temporizing in the USSR’s
approach to international negotiations on the Arab-Israeli question. It has sought
through talks with the US and others to influence US policy in the area and to
demonstrate to the world at large that the Soviet interest is in peace. The Soviets
place a high value on their brokerage function; they would be extremely dis-
pleased if, for example, Egypt sought to by-pass them in any serious negotiations
on the future of the area. But it seems certain that the Soviets are not ready
at this time to urge on their Arab clients the kind of concessions which might open
up the possibility of a genuine settlement.

18. This does not rule out the possibility of Soviet support at some point for
steps toward a modus vivendi to defuse the situation. In certain circumstances,
the Soviets might actively seek an arrangement which would diminish the dangers
of renewed hostilities while still allowing them to enjoy the fruits of continued
Arab-Israeli tension. Even here, however, Moscow must be concerned not only
with the terms of the arrangement but with the Arab reactions to them. In any
case, Moscow is not likely to put very heavy pressure on the Arabs—such as a
threat to suspend all arms aid—in order to bring about a modus vivendi.

19. The Soviets probably will be inclined to stay with a policy which will
bend with events, hoping by it to avoid being drawn into conflict, while rein-
forcing their political and military presence in the area. It may be, however, that
events—with an assist from the Israclis—will not permit the Soviets to main-
tain so comfortable and rewarding a course. Indeed, aggressive Israeli policies
against Egypt point up a sharpening Soviet dilemma: whether to seek to pre-
serve the Nasser regime by giving it a new level of support—thus increasing
the risk of direct Soviet involvement—or alternatively, to press the Arabs to-

SEQRET 7
Page-12
sega

ward a distasteful accommodation—thus risking a loss of influence in the Arab
world.

20. Soviet calculations have certainly taken into account that Israel has the
capability to develop and produce, and might soon be in a position to deploy,
nuclear weapons. The Soviets probably believe that such weapons would be
chiefly useful to Israel as a deterrent against Arab invasion—something not likely
to be attempted at any early date. Hence, while the USSR would take advantage
of any Israeli nuclear weapons to mount a political campaign against Israel and
to emphasize Arab dependence on the Soviets, it would probably not take seri-
ously the possibility of their actual use unless Israel faced a desperate situation.
Even in ‘such circumstances, although Soviets have the capability to deploy
nuclear weapons under their control on Egyptian territory, we think it highly
unlikely that they would do so even under heavy Arab pressure. They would
be more likely to threaten Israel from their own territory or from their ships
in the Mediterranean.

The Arab States

21. The degree of Soviet influence over individual Arab states varies—and
will continue to vary—considerably; it is probably highest in Egypt and nil in
Saudi Arabia. Among the revolutionary states, Syria, Iraq, and South Yemen
would be more susceptible to Soviet urging or advice than Algeria and Yemen.
Kuwait, Lebanon, and Jordan are not anxious to cooperate with the Soviets
but try to maintain good relations.

22. In Egypt, Moscow can influence the government's attitudes on a variety
of external questions and can expect to play some role in the formulation of
Egyptian economic and military policies. There is a great deal, however, that
the Soviets almost certainly cannot do in Egypt. They cannot guarantee that
Nasser will remain in power; his fate will depend on his health and on his own
political skills. They cannot dictate the choice of his successor since they lack
either a strong political organization within Egypt or a candidate for the suc-
cession whom they could cultivate without alienating Nasser himself. And,
in the last analysis, they cannot control Cairo’s behavior on questions the Egyp-
tians consider vital.

23. If Soviet influence over Egypt has its limitations, these are even more
marked elsewhere in the Arab world. Ideologically, the regime in Syria has a
good deal in common with Moscow, and it is almost wholly dependent on the
USSR for military equipment. Offsetting this, however, are several negative fac-
tors. Syrian nationalism is xenophobic. Of the Arab states bordering Israel, Syria
is the most intransigent, rejecting all efforts toward a political settlement and
encouraging a “war of national liberation.” Moreover, Syria is dominated by
a frequently changing coterie of military men; close Soviet relations with today’s

in paragraphs 41-51.

Icaders carry the risk of offending those of tomorrow. The latter consideration
also applies to Iraq. In Jordan, the Soviets have had little success in expanding,
their influence since Hussein has so far chosen to deal with the Western powers
which have long supported his regime and supplied his army. Soviet prospects
would presumably improve if Jordan accepted Soviet arms or if the fedayeen
came to dominate the regime.

24. Despite the USSR’s extensive influence in some Arab capitals, the fortunes
of individual governments in the Arab world are largely beyond Moscow's ability
to control. The Soviets cannot guarantee a regime's survival, nor can they be as-
sured of success should they seek to bring one down. The Soviets will thus prob-
ably stand aside in the event of important disruptions, moving in to attempt to
capitalize on events as the dust settles, Though surely concerned about the un-
certainties which would flow from Nasser’s removal, and though they would
seek to forestall such an eventuality, active Soviet intervention on behalf of
Nasser would be unlikely. Revolutions in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, or Kuwait might
be cheered by the Soviets, but could not now be inspired by them.

25. There are still further complications in Soviet dealings with the Arab world.
The trade of most of the states of the area is still heavily oriented toward the
West.* Moreover, while the radical Arabs are united in their hostility to Israel,
the governments of Egypt, Syria, and Iraq profoundly dislike and distrust one
another. They are actively competitive in inter-Arab affairs, and Soviet policies
concerning one may seriously complicate policies toward another,

26. The Soviets have for the most part limited their dealings and their ma-
terial support to existing governments, but there have been exceptions. Thus,
the USSR provided arms and diplomatic support to the FLN during the Algerian
revolution; it has consistently championed a special status for the Kurds in Iraq;
it has also tried (though modestly) to promote the fortunes of Communist parties
in such countries as Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.

27. With the fedayeen, the Soviets have dealt cautiously, mostly through in-
termediaries. This is partly because of the fedayeen’s penchant for free-wheeling
militancy, which Moscow cannot hope to control, and partly because of its re-
luctance to get involved in rivalries between them and governments of the area.
Yet the Soviets now appear to believe that dealing with the fedaycen exclusively
through the medium of Arab governments will no longer suffice in the face of
an emerging sense of a Palestinian identity. Peking’s vocal support of fedayeen
extremism adds to Soviet inducements to keep lines out to these movements.
Although a Fatah delegation has been in Moscow recently, the visit was unofficial,
and arms to the fedayeen probably will continue to be channeled through area
governments. Soviet support for the fedayeen will continue to be discreet, in an
effort to avoid antagonizing Arab governments.

‘See Appendix, Table II.

Non-Arab States

28. Concerning Israel itself, Moscow does not have full mastery over its own
policies. It is obliged by its relations with the radical Arabs, in fact, to maintain
a hostile attitude. This is made easier by the USSR’s unremitting opposition to
“Zionism,” which the Soviet leaders see as an internal security problem in the
USSR and Eastern Europe. As noted, Soviet policy does not seek the destruction
of Israel. Not only would this remove the Soviets’ principal leverage on the
Arabs; Moscow also recognizes that Western military and political support makes
Israel a factor with which the Soviets must contend.

29. The USSR enjoys no special relationship with Greece, Turkey,> or Iran
and, in fact, suffers from the legacy of the period when it posed an active threat
to all three. Soviet ambitions in these states are curbed by the membership of
all three in US-supported alliance systems and, in general, by the anti-Communist
convictions of all three governments. Nonetheless, Soviet relations with these
states have improved as a consequence of a major Soviet effort—begun almost
a decade ago—to recast its image into that of a peace-loving and benevolent
neighbor. Economic aid to both Turkey and Iran, sales of military equipment
to Iran, and promises of a profitable trade with Greece are intended to add
substance to the new image.

30. Economically, at least, Iran has gone the furthest in response; it has con-
tracted for at least $115 million worth of Soviet arms, and a Soviet sponsored
650 mile pipeline—now nearing completion—will bring over $60 million worth
of natural gas annually from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Caucasus. Turkey
has accepted some Soviet economic aid and seeks to avoid antagonism in the re-
lationship, but the climate between the two countries is certainly not warm.
Greece under the junta is vigorously anti-Communist, and trade will probably
remain the most significant contact with the USSR. Moscow probably expects
at least Turkey and Iran to draw farther away from the US and hopes to benefit
from such movement. But the chances for a significant increase in Soviet influence
in these three countries will be limited for some time to come.

IV. POLICIES IN THE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN

North Africa

31. Though the western Mediterranean is not without its attractions and its
opportunities for the makers of Soviet policy, the USSR’s presence is far less
conspicuous and its prospects are much less promising than in the Middle East.
Two circumstances shape the politics of the area in ways not wholly congenial
to Soviet interests, First, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have had long associa-
tions with France which have shaped their cultures, their economic associations,
and their political outlooks. Second, though there is wide popular support for
the Palestinian cause within the west Arab states, their government leaders are

*See NIE 29.2-70, “Turkey Over The Next Five Years,” dated 3 February 1970, SECRET.

10 SEQRET

segfer

less willing than the eastern Arabs to accept Nasser’s leadership, less dependent
on Soviet support, and more suspicious of the policies and motives of both
Nasser and the USSR.

32. Recent developments in North Africa pose further obstacles to the growth
of Soviet influence there. Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco are patching up old
quarrels which for a time contributed to Algeria’s desire for Soviet support.
These states are, in addition, moving somewhat closer to France as a result of
French efforts to improve relations. Moreover, in the wake of the Libyan coup,
concern over the westward extension of Nasser’s influence has grown in all three
countries. Their tendency to draw together may in time produce a sense of com-
munity divergent from that of the eastern Arab nations.*

33. Algeria is more revolutionary, more anticolonialist, and more anti-US than
Morocco and Tunisia. It is thus easier for the Algerians to find a common cause
with both the Egyptians and the Soviets. The Algerians have received substantial
amounts of Soviet arms and military training assistance as well as Soviet support
in a variety of economic development projects. But they have not allowed the
Soviets to influence their domestic affairs, to interfere with their relationship
with France, to reorient the great bulk of their trade away from Western Europe,
or to guide the course of Algerian foreign policy in general. There has also been
recent evidence of frictions in Soviet-Algerian relations, Algeria has views on
some international issues which coincide with those of the USSR; yet it is not a
client state, nor is it likely to become one.

34. Libya’s military junta is unsure of its internal position and uncertain
about both domestic and foreign policies. The junta, or at least its head, Colonel
Qaddafi, has sought and received support—1,500 troops and several hundred
technicians and advisers, as well as public backing—from Nasser. The latter
no doubt welcomes the chance to extend his own direct influence into Libya,
and he would be disinclined to see this eroded by the USSR’s playing a major
role there. The Libyan regime, perhaps at Cairo’s urging, has several times
rebuffed Soviet diplomatic overtures and Soviet offers of arms; it apparently
prefers to buy from France and other Western suppliers. At least as long as the
present junta stays in power, we think it unlikely that the Soviets will gain
significant influence in Libya.

35. This is not to say that Libya lacks attraction for the Soviets. The USSR’s
Egyptian-marked reconnaissance aircraft flying from Egypt can cover the Medi-
terranean as far west as Sardinia. The use of Wheelus airfield in Libya would
extend the range of TU-16 reconnaissance aircraft beyond Gibraltar. Moscow
might thus seek to pressure Nasser into exerting his influence on the Libyan
junta to provide these facilities for Soviet use. Nasser would be reluctant to
do so, but he is deeply beholden to the Soviets, and it is possible that he might
agree to some such arrangement—and the Libyans reluctantly acquiesce in it—
if Soviet’ pressures were severe, Even in these circumstances, Soviet use of

Libyan facilities would probably be limited and covert. Only a very small Soviet
presence would be required, especially if Soviet activities were confined to
refueling.

36. Malta is also attractive to Soviet planners inasmuch as its location is
strategic and its economy faltering. If Malta is unable to strengthen its economy
through assistance from the West, it may turn to the Soviets for aid. Overtures
have been made by the Soviets, but thus far Soviet fleet visits have been denied
and Soviet offers to provide economic assistance have been declined. Elections
must be held by March 1971; a chapge in government could pave the way for
closer association with the Soviets. Although the Soviets may seck limited fa-
ities in Algeria, Libya, and Malta through which to stage their reconnaissance
aircraft, none of these countries is likely to extend such facilities at this time.

   

European States

37. In Wester Europe, Soviet policy aims currently at promoting an atmos-
phere of detente and ultimately at reducing the US presence on the continent.
Moscow will not wish to jeopardize these objectives by initiatives in the Medi-
terranean which would alarm the countries of Western Europe. It probably
calculates that moves which seemed to threaten to cut off Western Europe from
the Arab countries and their oil would stiffen the Western posture toward the
Soviets—both in the Mediterranean and in Europe itself—and help consolidate
ties between Western Europe and the US.

38. In fact, there are now signs of some change in European attitudes—a
gradual increase in concern over the growing Soviet presence in the Mediter-
ranean. No general alarms have yet been sounded, nor does there appear to
have been any significant political pressure for changes in overall policies
toward the USSR. But concem is increasing in West European military circles
and this has been reflected in specific countermeasures under NATO auspices,
such as the establishment of NATO machinery to monitor the activities of the
Soviet naval squadron in the Mediterranean.

39. France, which has strong interests in certain Arab states, has been the
most active of the West European states in the Mediterranean. In recent months
Pompidou has sought to enhance France’s position as a Mediterranean power
by improving relations and influence with countries on both shores of the Medi-
terranean from Gibraltar to Greece. The Soviets have sought to take advantage
of this policy, specifically of French support of the Arabs in their contest with
Israel. But while Moscow has tried to use France to divide the Western powers—
as in the Four Power talks on a Middle Eastern settlement—the Soviets must
also be concerned that the French are their rivals. The sale of French arms to
Libya, for example, may have deprived the USSR of an opportunity to sell its
own weapons to that country and prevented it from extending its influence over
the Libyan junta. Similarly, France's efforts in North Africa will help to counter
Soviet influence in Algeria and to block it in Morocco and Tunisia.

V. SOVIET CAPABILITIES AND INTENTIONS IN CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES

40. The enlarged Soviet military presence in the Mediterranean area has
substantially increased Soviet influence and required all interested states, in-
cluding the US, to take account of Soviet attitudes and possible actions. How
and in what circumstances the Soviets might make actual use of their military
power is considerably less clear. The paragraphs which follow examine possible
Soviet actions and capabilities in four major contingencies: (a) Arab-Israeli
hostilities short of a full-scale conflict, i.e. the present situation; (b) all-out
Arab-Israeli war; (c) other axea disputes in which Soviet interests were in-
volved; and (d) East-West hostilities.

Arab-Israeli Hostilities Short of All-Out War

41, The current success of Isracli military activities against the Arab states
has no doubt added to Soviet disillusionment with the Arabs’ ability to use
modern equipment effectively. At the same time, Israeli activities increase Arab
pressures on the Soviets for more advanced types of equipment. The Soviets
have turned down a number of Arab requests in the past and have to date care-
fully limited both the quantity and quality of arms shipments, partly because
of the Arabs’ limited ability to absorb such materiel. They are in the awk-
ward position of having provided enough to be thoroughly involved, but of not
having supplied support of a kind or nature to do a successful job of defending
Egypt. Appeals from Cairo for additional help have become more urgent as
Israeli raids have intensified.

42. Moscow is clearly aware that greater direct involvement entails heightened
risks. It must be concerned that substantially greater assistance to the Arabs
would not satisfy them but only stimulate demands for even greater Soviet
support in the future. Not only would large-scale effort be very costly to the
Soviets, but it would involve such an enlarged Soviet presence as to change
the character of the Soviet-Egyptian relationship in ways that would raise prob-
lems for both parties. Yet these hazards have to be weighed against alternatives
which may seem to the Soviets to be at least equally unpalatable. Certainly
Moscow does not like to see Cairo helpless in the face of Israeli air assaults.
Certainly it does not wish this sort of circumstance to weaken Nasser’s position
and jeopardize domestic stability in the UAR. And certainly it would be fearful
that a refusal to aid the UAR in its hour of need would threaten to disrupt
relations with Egypt and damage Soviet prestige throughout the Arab world.

43. We believe that the Soviets will decide, if they have not already done
so, that some sort of favorable response to Egyptian requests is necessary unless
Israeli attacks near Cairo are soon stopped. A decision by the US to provide
additional modern aircraft to Israel would make such a Soviet response even
more likely, But it will not suffice to increase the flow of air defense equip-
ment the Egyptians already have, as the Soviets have recently done. The prin-
cipal Egyptian problem is the lack of certain more advanced weapons systems
and above all of qualified personnel to operate an integrated air defense system

SEGRET 13

effectively. Hence any significant improvement in Egyptian defenses, at least in
the short run, would almost certainly require Soviet personnel to man the net-
work.

44. Additional Soviet support for Egypt's air defense could be at various levels.
An integrated defense designed to protect the Cairo area might involve pro-
viding advanced interceptors, several battalions of advanced SA missiles, and
additional antiaircraft artillery (AAA). Major elements of such a system would
have to be directed, operated, and maintained by Soviet personnel, including
pilots, for a considerable period, perhaps indefinitely. The Soviets might hope
that this system would deter attacks on Cairo or subject the Israeli Air Force
to unacceptable losses. While this system would leave other prime areas open
to attack, the Soviets might calculate that it would suffice to serve Nasser’s
political needs.

45. If the Soviets felt that they had to provide protection for the bulk of
Egypt’s population, industry, and military installations, they would have to turn
to more sophisticated equipment and establish air defense coverage of the lower
Nile valley and the Suez Canal area. Such a system would require expanded
early warning ground control intercept (EW/GCI) radars, many more advanced
interceptors, greater numbers of improved SA missiles and additional AAA for
key point defenses. To make the system operational within a few months would
require the introduction of entire Soviet units involving many thousands of men.

46. The foregoing discussion of possible Soviet levels of support for Egyptian
air defense is only illustrative; a number of variations are conceivable. The
Soviets would of course. strongly prefer to keep their support at the lowest
possible levels of risk and cost. In deciding what levels of support would prove
sufficient to their objectives, their risk/advantage calculus would have to weigh
possible Israeli responses as well as Nasser’s requirements, In view of the stake
the Soviets have in Nasser’s survival, and in the preservation of their relations
with the radical Arabs, the Soviets may feel obliged to enlarge their risks.

47. To deter Israeli raids the Soviets might consider deploying in Egypt
missiles with HE warheads capable of striking Israel proper. The Soviets, how-
ever, would have to weigh the chances that such a deployment would simply
provoke the Israelis into larger attacks, perhaps on these missile installations
themselves. Moreover, the threat of indiscriminate missile attacks on Israeli
cities, let alone the actual delivery of such attacks, would involve the Soviets
in an undertaking repugnant to much of world opinion, and one they would
necessarily estimate would greatly increase the chances of direct US involve-
ment. For these reasons, we think it highly unlikely that the Soviets would
deploy such weapons. Similarly, we think it virtually inconceivable that they
would consider deploying CW weapons there.

48. It might be that, coincident with moves for some form of greater support
in Egypt's defense, the USSR would put pressure on the Egyptians to agree to
military or diplomatic steps to defuse the present tension. Once Egypt’s defenses

14 sf

SEMRET

seemed more ‘formidable, the Soviets might feel more free to encourage a cease-
fire, whether formal or tacit. They will probably continue to be unresponsive to
US appeals for a formal agreement to limit arms shipments to the Middle East,
but if the crisis continues to intensify, they might tacitly consent to curb addi-
tional arms shipments to Egypt if the US makes no additional aircraft sales
to Israel.

Full-Scale Arab-Israeli. War

49. Full-scale Arab-Israeli war could not be simply a replay of the 1967
war, if only because the Israelis now occupy extensive Arab territories. What-
ever the course of the military action, the Soviets would surely not want to
show themselves to be as helpless as they were in 1967. The presence of num-
bers of Soviet advisers with Egyptian and Syrian troops and of naval units in
the area would make for a degree of involvement in any case. Whether the
Soviets would consider intervening in a larger and more overt way would pre-
sumably depend on the course and duration of the war, and above all on their’
estimate of the US response.

50. Present Soviet capabilities to intervene in such a war with quick and
decisive effect are significant but not appreciably greater than they were in
June 1967. Although Egypt has made facilities available to the Soviet squadron
and to naval reconnaissance aircraft, there are no Soviet ground or tactical air
units ashore in the Mediterranean area. The Soviets could bring in such forces
from the USSR, but they would have difficulty in making them operationally
effective in a: short-lived war. The USSR could also provide some covert mili-
tary support—pilots in Egyptian-marked planes flying against Israel or, more
likely, in defense of Arab cities; ground support crews; and perhaps some naval
personnel.

51. But given the probability of Israeli victory in fairly short order, the odds
would be high that the Soviets would fear involving themselves militarily in
a losing cause, with all the political damage within and outside the area that
this would entail. Since the Soviets would have an effect only if they intervened
quickly, and on a scale which they would estimate would risk involving the
US, we doubt that they would embark on such an adventure.

Intervention in Other Area Disputes

52. The instability of certain client states of the USSR and various disputes
between Arab states could produce situations which threatened the USSR’s
friends or interests. In such circumstances, the Soviets might be tempted to use
military force—as they have done in a limited way in the Yemen civil war.
Such possibilities could arise in the course of the chronic factional struggles
in Syria or Iraq, or if there were a request for direct Soviet military help from
Nasser in-a domestic crisis. In a situation involving struggle between rival Arab
groups, Moscow might think it could preempt a Western move by moving in
troops itself. At present the Soviets have a limited capability for rapid interven-

be

tion. There may be as many as 500 naval infantry troops with the Mediterranean
squadron—sufficient for a token landing. A substantial force could be moved
in relatively quickly from the USSR, but this would entail overflight problems
with Iran, Turkey, or Yugoslavia.

53. The Soviets would almost certainly be reluctant to commit their own armed
forces in the Middle East for such purposes. For one thing, coups in the Middle
East usually occur too quickly for intervention by outside powers to be decisive.
More basically, the Soviets have no wish to find themselves embroiled in Arab
domestic strife, particularly if there is a risk of finding themselves on the losing
side, And they are likely to avoid any actions—such as moving troops into Syria—
which might bring about all-out Arab-Israeli warfare or threaten to involve the
US. In general, the rule that the Soviets prefer to avoid risks in unpredictable
and uncontrolled situations would apply in such cases.

 

East-West Hosti

54. In nuclear war, the Soviets’ primary concern in the Mediterranean would
be to limit damage from Western strategic forces, particularly ballistic missile
submarines. At this time, Soviet ASW capabilities against the latter are ex-
tremely poor, despite the deployment of more modern ASW surface ships, in-
cluding the helicopter ship, Moskva. Newer classes of Soviet ships, including
nuclear-powered attack submarines, may soon be deployed to the Mediterranean.
By 1975 Soviet capabilities to detect Polaris-type submarines may be some-
what improved, especially in restricted areas such as the Mediterranean. But
the Soviets would still be unable to impair gravely the value of Polaris as a
strategic weapon in the Mediterranean.’

ies.

55. At present, Soviet military capabilities for non-nuclear war with Western
powers in the Mediterranean are limited by the lack of tactical air support and
an inadequate and vulnerable logistics system. A significant effort to ameliorate
these shortcomings would be extremely expensive and would draw down from
more pressing general purpose force needs elsewhere. Efforts to acquire military
bases for use in such conflicts would be a difficult and politically risky course.
In the event of a major crisis in this area, the Soviets would be able to augment
their Mediterranean naval squadron. If conflict were to break out, they would
seek to attack Western naval forces, particularly aircraft carriers. In addition,
the Soviet threat to Western naval forces and lines of communication would
be enhanced by the difficulties of detecting Soviet submarines, and by the
USSR’s capability of bringing more submarines into the Mediterranean from
the Atlantic.

VI. LONG TERM PROSPECTS

56. Some aspects of the Soviet position in the Mediterranean area are of

course susceptible to direct Soviet control. The strength of the USSR’s naval

squadron, the size of its military and economic assistance programs, and the
degree of its political support for radical Arab objectives all are dependent on
decisions made in Moscow. But many of the basic circumstances which shape
Soviet policy in the area are determined in the main by decisions made else-
where—in Tel Aviv, in Cairo, in Washington. In the totality, then, the USSR
is only one of several principal actors in the area and it is always possible
that—as during the June War of 1967—it will find itself playing a part not
entirely of its own devising.

  

57. It is true nonetheless that Moscow's assumption of a leading role in the
area is a significant and probably durable accomplishment. It does not now
appear that the USSR will again be content to play a minor role in the Middle
East and the Mediterranean. Even in the event of another Arab-Israeli war and
another defeat for major Soviet clients, the Soviets would almost certainly
retain some sort of position in the area—though it would probably for a time
be reduced—and would continue to have a voice in the shaping of postwar
configurations. With or without such a war, the political climate of the region
is likely to remain generally turbulent. Radical nationalist forces will continue
to work against Western interests in the area and in their endeavors will no
doubt continue to find Soviet support.

58. It seems entirely plausible that Soviet estimates of the USSR’s prospects
in the Mediterranean basin do not depart substantially from the general picture
sketched above. In any case the Soviets must be optimistic about their
ability to remain among the major movers of the area. Still, over a decade of
close involvement with their mercurial clients has probably persuaded them
to be fairly cautious in their assessments. Certainly they can have few illusions
about the military capabilities of the Arab states. And just as certainly they can-
not believe that the problems of the more immediate future will always resolve
themselves to the benefit of Soviet interests. By the same token, however, occa-
sional setbacks and miscalculations will probably not seriously discourage them
or deflect them from their course. In any case, the rivalry between the US and
the USSR in the Mediterranean is likely to persist at least so long as the con-
test between them continues in the world at large.
