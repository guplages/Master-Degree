THE IMPORTANCE OF IRANIAN AND MIDDLE EAST OIL

TO WESTERN EUROPE UNDER PEACETIME CONDITIONS

_ - THE PROBLEM
‘To estimate the importance of (a) Irantan oll production and (b) total Middle East off

_ production to Western Europe in time of peace.

1, The amount of crude oll and refined prod- _
uets now exported from Iran could be derived
from other areas by small increases in crude
production and by fuller use of available re-
fining capacity. At the rates of consumption
and levels of prices prevailing at the end of
1950, the extra annual dollar charge to Ewrope~
of procuring this amount of of] elsewhere
would be about $700,000,000.*

2. Loss of Iranian oll production and of the
refinery at Abadan would temporarily have
an adverse effect upon Western European eco-
nomic activity, and would impose severe finan-
_ efal losses particularly upon the British, who
control all the ofl production of the count
Aithough the effect of the loss of Iran on
volume of petroleum which could be made
available to Western Europe might ‘be over-

 
  
 
   
  

extra annual dollar costs and of the extent of oll
shortages which would result from a loss of Tranian
oll sre indicative rather than

as oll prices stay at
_. production and ‘consumption continue at the rates

. currently estimated for the fiscal year 1950-51. The ~
general effect of the rearmament programs in the
U8 and in Western Europe will presumably be to
= raise the consumption of oll, and probably ¢ls0 to
raine its price. These factors would fend to make
the ofl of the Middle Fast more important to the
weatern economies, and to caute its Joss to be even
more severely felt than is indicated by the figures
cited In this paper.

ASSUMPTIONS

That access to (a) Iranian ofi production, and (b) total Middle East oil production is
denied to the Western Powers by means other than war. .

financial effects would be overcome slowly, if
at all. :

LOSS OF ALL MIDDLE EAST OIL.

8. ‘The loss of all Middle East of] production
would reduce the current supply of crude oll
in the non-Soviet world by about 93 million
metric tons per year. By increasing produc-
tion to the greatest degree feasible in areas
still accessible, this shortage could be reduced
to about 53 million metric tons, which is equiv-
alent to about 10 percent of estimated 1950-51
total oil consumption in the non-Soviet world.
Sufficient refining capacity would be available
to process the reduced total supply of crude,
but the problems of readjustment and ailoca-
* tion mentioned in paragraph 5 above would,
of course, be greater, and the time required to
carry them out would be longer. .

9. The maximum cutback in Western Euro-
. pean of] consumption which would still per-
mit maintenance of industrial production at
approximately the levels of late 1950, and of
transportation at the extreme minimum nec-
essary for that purpose, is estimated to be
about 10 percent. Such a cutback would
permit no appreciable expansion of industry,
whether for normal economic development or
for purposes of rearmament, unless economies
were effected, expansion of industry and
-transportation facilities were accomplished
only with solid fuel-utilizing equipment, and
possibly some conversion of existing petro-
Jeum-using equipment were made. More-
over, the 10 percent cutback would cover
only about 6.6 million metric tons out of
the total deficiency of 53 million. Hence it
_ ig clear that even if Western Europe were
~ restricted to less than 90 percent of its estl-
mated 1950-51 consumption, the loss of all
Middle East ofl would make substantial ra-
tioning in the United States, Des-
pite the fact that the US is virtually self-suffi-
. lent in ofl production, it would have to cut
its consumption by at least 10 percent. In-
ternational allocation would immediately be-
come necessary. .

10, At the price level of late 1950 a net in-
crease in dollar requirements of from $1 to
$1.2 billion would occur if Western Europe,
_ after a cutback of 10 percent in its consump-

tion, were to procure from alternative sources
an amount of oil sufficient to make up for the
Joss of Middle East imports.

11, No way can be foreseen at present by which
a satisfactory adjustment, over a longer period
of time, could be made to the total Joss of
Middle East oll, unless new reserves are proved
elsewhere, or new sources of energy developed.
Though the Middle East now contributes only
18.4 percent of total non-Soviet production, it
contains 44.4 percent of proved reserves out-
side the Soviet orbit. A very large proportion
of the presently contemplated increase in non-
Soviet oil supply is expected to come from the
Middle East. Western Europe, therefore,
would not be able to compensate for the loss
of Middle East off save by profound changes in
its currently planned economic structure.

SPECIAL EFFECTS UPON THE
UNITED KINGDOM .

12, The effects of a loss of Middle East of)

upon the UK, though no less adverse, would
be somewhat different in nature from the ef-
fects upon most other Western European
countries, in which the physical shortage of

~ gupply and the expenditure of dollars neces-

sary to replace it would be the factors most
immediately paramount. Jven after the loss
of the Middle East, British companies would
own about 35 percent of available crude pro-
duction apart from that in the US and Can-
ada—te., they would control more than one-
third of the exportable surplus of ol! available
to the non-Soviet powers. (US companies
would own about one-half of crude produc-
tion outside the US and Canada.) There
‘would be more than enough oll under the con-
trol of the British to supply all thelr domestic
requirements, plus bunkers and military lift-
ings, if they chose to give priority to domestic
requirements over other markets. Hence, the
UK would have a fairly strong bargaining po-
sition in the negotiations which would be nec-
for the international allocation of avail-
able ofl supplies, after the loss of Middle East-
ern output.
18. On the other hand, the financial setback
to the British resulting from the loss of their
enormous investments in Middle East oil, ea-

pecially in Iran, and of the receipts both fn ~

dollars and in soft currencies which arise from
them, would tend to offset any special advan-
tages which the UK might derive from its
ownership of other sources of supply. Loss of
the economic (and strategic) power which the
UK now possesses by virtue of its control over
the production and distribution of Middle

~

East oll would also be a factor of utmost im-
portance. Finally, the effects which a total
Joss of Middie East off would Indirectly exert
upon the general structure of international
trade and payments would be especially ad-
verse to the UK because of its extraordinary
dependence upon overseas trade.
