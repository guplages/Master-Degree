THE WORLD BREADGRAIN SITUATION 1948-49
, AND 1949-50 OUTLOOK"

SUMMARY ©

Smaller crops of breadgrain will be har-
vested in 1949 than in 1948 when the world
produced 217 million metric tons, its best crop
of wheat and rye since the end of hostilities.
Larger farm and off-farm stocks of bread-
grain, however, were carried over on 30 June
1949 in exporting countries, particularly in
the United States and the USSR, than were
carried over on 30 June 1948. This increase
in stocks carried over into the marketing year
beginning 1 July 1949 and ending 30 June
1950. will wholly or in part offset the drop in
the 1949 world production. :

If importers maintain their wheat and rye
consumption on the 1948-49 level, at least
as much breadgrain must be shipped during
1949-50 as was marketed during 194849. A
large part of the breadgrain entering inter-
national trade will be marketed without re-
gard to any price guarantee since only part
of the world’s 1949-50 export availability of
breadgrain will be equitably distributed

among importers within the price range guar-.

anteed by the International Wheat Agree-
ment, to which the USSR and Argentina have
not subscribed. ;

The USSR enters the 1949-50 trade year
with farm and off-farm stocks larger than the
2 million metric tons quota that the Inter-
national Wheat Conference refused to grant.
There is, also, the prospect of a somewhat
larger breadgrain production in 1949 than
that of last year, which places the Soviet
Union in a position prospectively better than
at any time since the war. If the Kremlin so

decrees, the USSR can throw breadgrain onto
the international market in excess of the 2
million metric tons quota denied by the Inter-
national Wheat Conference.

An increase in barter and other trade agree-
ments among non-dollar countries to cireum-
vent dollar shortage may be expected to char-
acterize international market manipulations
during 1949-50, especially if the USSR invades
the international markets.

Total 1949 production of breadgrain in the
satellites may be not more and possibly less
than last year. Carry-over stocks are rela-
tively low except possibly in Yugoslavia and
Albania.

As of 15 July, a decrease of 1 to 2 million
metric tons is expected in the breadgrain pro-
duction of northern and western Europe (in-
cluding northwest Africa). Average off-farm
supplies in this area at the beginning of the
1949-50 trade year were below normal.

The Middle East (including northeast’
Africa) entered the 1949-50 trade year with
about 1 million tons of breadgrain in off-farm
storage and the prospects of a production as
large as that of 1948. No change in the pro-
duction and import requirements in other
African countries is expected.

In the Indian Subcontinent and the deficit
countries of the Far East, carry-over stocks
are low and the 1949 production of breadgrain
is expected to be less than that of 1948.

Australia with an export quota of 2.2 mil-
lion metric tons may export 3 million tons of

wheat during 1949-50 unless unfavorable

weather conditions develop before the harvest
next fall.

Argentina enters the 1949-50 trade year

* with abnormally low stocks of about 1.1 mil-
lion tons. Acreage and production are ex-
pected to continue at the low level of 1948-49.

-Combined 1949-50 production among other
South American countries and in the Carib-
bean area may be expected to be about the
same as last year with about the same import
requirements.

The 1949 Canadian wheat crop is 3.2 million
metric tons below the good harvest of 1948,
However, at the expense of end-of-year stocks,
Canada can fulfill the 5.5 million ton export

quota granted by the International Wheat
Agreement.

The United States has a 1949-50 potential
export supply of 14.3 million metric tons. The
export quota under the wheat agreement is
4.6 million metric tons. Adding 5.6 million
tons as probable shipments to occupied coun-
tries gives 10.2 million metric tons. of foreseen
shipments. This leaves a potential of 4.1 mil-
lion metric tons available for stabilizing the
non-guaranteed markets in case of any emer-
gency. . “

Despite a decline in production, the United
States is still in a sufficiently strong position
to meet the demands of the breadgrain mar-
kets of the world during 1949-50, within the.
framework of abilities of importers to pay.

THE WORLD BREADGRAIN SITUATION 1948-49
AND 1949-50 OUTLOOK

1, The 1948-49 Breadgrain Situation.

a, The’ Importers.

Early in the summer of 1948, it appeared
that for the first time since the war there
would be as much breadgrain for export as
world markets would take within the frame-
work of abilities to pay. Surveys of require-
ments of the majority of importing countries,
taking"into consideration abilities to pay, in-
dicated that the import markets of the world
would take during the 12 months 1 July 1948
through 30 June 1949 a combined total of 27.8

‘ “million metric tons of breadgrain' compared
with 26.2 million metric tons * reported to have
been shipped to these same markets during
the 12 months 1 July 1947 through 30 June
1948.

_ (1) Turnover Supplies Low at Beginning of
* 1948-49.

. Shipments of 26.2 million metric tons of
- breadgrain by exporters during 1947-48 added
.to the combined indigenous production of the
importing countries concerned, .estimated at
13.8* million metric tons, indicated a 1947-48
combined gross supply‘ of 100.0 million met-
ric tons, which was practically equal to the
average prewar gross supply of 100.4 million
metric tons available to these same importers

during the 5 years 1933-34 through 1937-38.
In the interim between the prewar period
and 1947-48, population had increased roughly

 

‘The estimated quantity of grain that world mar_
kets would take during 1948-49 is the combined total
(adjusted as of 12 April 1949) of allocations of

-breadgrain made by the Cereal Committee of the
rv- International Emergency. Food Committee of the
- United Nations after formal hearings of require-
"+ ments presented by each country concerned. These
+ ‘countries: included Finland and Czechoslovakia but
not Spain. ”
« -*The total quantity of recorded shipments during
~ 1947-48 was 268 million metric tons. The figure
“+262 million tons does not include 0.6 million tons of
breadgrain. shipped to Albania, Bulgaria, Poland,
“Rumania, and the Soviet Zone of Germany during
é

10 percent so that per capita gross supply
during 1947-48 was appreciably less than.the
average per capita supply during 1933-34
through 1937-38 and was insufficient to meet
normal requirements.

Betause of the drain placed on farm and
off-farm stocks of breadgrain in attempts to
cover consumption and other requirements
during 1947-48, most of the-importing coun-
tries of the world entered the trade year 1948-_
49 with customary turnover supplies at a
minimum.

(2) Turnover Supplies Still Below Normal
at End of 1948-49.

In 1948, the importing countries produced
domestically a combined total of 86.8 million
metric tons. Import requirement, estimated
at 27.8 million tons, indicated a combined
gross supply for all utilization during 1948-49
of 114.6 million tons.

This improved supply (14.6 percent greater
than that of the previous year) enabled most
of the peoples of the world to eat more bread
of better quality than at any other time since
the outbreak of the war. Not only did peoples
in certain countries eat better, but in several
countries customary turnover supplies have
been built up to nearly normal while a few
fortunate countries with better indigenous
production than others carried over into the
1949-50 marketing year some reserve stocks,

 

1947-48, because no allocations were made to these
areas during 1948-49,

“The estimated production of 73.8 million metric
tons does not include the production of Bulgaria,
Poland, Rumania, and the Soviet Zone of Germany,
which were normally exporters but which because
of poor indigenous production were forced to import
during 1947-48. Also, the insignificant production
of Albania does not come into consideration.

‘The term “gross” supply of breadgrain implies.
stocks on farms for seed, allowances for waste
(usually 3 percent), feed for livestock, also indus-
trial utilization, human consumption as well as off-
farm turnover supplies and other carry-over stocks.

It is not possible to estimate with any de-
gree of exactness the 1948-49 balance between
supply and. utilization among the importers,
as a whole, but it is-highly probable that on
the average throughout the world, end-of-the
year ' off-farm supplies in importing countries
were below normal.

“b. The Exporters.

As stated above, the International Emer-
gency Food Committee estimated the 1948-49
effective demand for breadgrain at 27.8 mil-
lion metric tons of which 24.6 million tons
were prorated on the basis of estimated export
availabilities among the United States, Can-
ada, and Australia for orderly marketing to a
majority of importers throughout the world.
It was assumed that Argentina and the USSR
would be in a position to ship about 1.6 and
1.2 million tons respectively and that a few
small exporters might Possibly ship 0.4 million
tons more or less.

The three major exporters under the super-
vision of the International Emergency Food
Committee, within a small margin more or
less, fulfilled their export quotas by 30 June
1949. Argentina shipped 1.7 million metric
tons of breadgrain during 1948-49 while the
USSR is estimated to have shipped 1.1 million
tons. The small exporters had already ex-
ceeded expectancy by the end of the first 6
month (30 December 1948). As of 30 June

1949, combined shipments by exporters are ©

estimated at around 27.0 million metric tons.
ce. Allocation of Breadgrain Abandoned,

During the trade years 1947-48 and part of 7

1948-49, the orderly adjustment of export
availabilities to import requirements was ef-
fected largely through the operations of the
Cereals Committee of the International Emer-
gency Food Committee of the United Nations.

Because of the large 1948-49 supply, prices
of wheat and rye on the markets of the world
declined. Also, because of the large supply in
Sight, the allocation of breadgrain to import-
ers was abandoned as of the end of March

 

‘The end of the 1948-49 international trade year
is 30 June 1949. The end of the consumption year,
normally 31 July in Europe, may: vary somewhat
among the various importing countries.

1949. The Cereals Committee was dissolved
in April 1949.

Although the Cereals Committee will no
longer influence orderly marketing between
consignor and consignee during 1949-50, the
breadgrain markets of an important propor-
tion of importers will in part be stabilized by
the operations of the International Wheat
Council under the provisions of the Inter-
national Wheat Agreement,

d. The International Wheat Agreement.

The International Wheat Agreement guar-
antees that within the range of agreed upon
ceiling and floor prices, a substantial number
of importers will take a minimum of 12.41
million tons of wheat annually from Canada,
the United States, Australia, France, and
Uruguay over a term of four years beginning
1 July 1949.

‘The export quota of the United States is
4.57 million. metric tons (168 million bush-
els),’ which importers agree to take at not
more than a ceiling price of $66.14: nor
less than $55.11 per ton ($1.80 to $1.50 per
bushel)."

After the agreed quota has been met, an
importer can buy additional wheat anywhere
at any negotiated price. Non-signers of the
agreement can buy at any time at any nego-
tiated price.

Orderly marketing under the agreement
will be supervised by the International Wheat
Council made up of delegates, one for each
ratifying country.

Argentina refused to enter the agreement
on grounds of price and the USSR dropped
out before final discussions when unable to
get an annual export quota of roughly 2.0
million metric tons of wheat.

 

*Other quotas are: 5.52 million tons to Canada;
2.18 million tons to Australia; 0.90 million tons to
France and 0.49 million tons to Uruguay. In addi.
tion, the United States may ship 5.6 million tons to
the occupied countries resulting in foreseen com-
bined shipments of 19.2 million metric tons.

"Ceiling prices remain throughout the period at
$1.80 per bushel for Canadian wheat at Fort Wil-
lam or at Port Arthur, which is equivalent to about
$1.92 per bushel at Gulf Ports, Stmilar floor prices
diminish at the rate of 10 cents per year to $1.20
per bushel in.1953. .

. Either country, within the framework of ex-
port availabilities can enter the market at any

time to take advantage of ceiling prices or to
force.prices to the floor.

_Q) Unguaranteed Markets.

". Foreseen shipments under the wheat agree-
ment. plus shipments to ‘occupied countries
‘total 19.2 million metric tons.” With an ex-
pected import requirement of about 27 million
metric tons, negotiations for-8 or more million
tons of. export wheat and rye may activate
buying and selling on the unguaranteed mar-
ets of the world during 1949-50."

- e@, Carry-Over Supplies, -

As indicated above, importers as a whole,
largely because of inadequate abilities to pay,
entered the current trade year on 1 July 1949
with turnover supplies somewhat below nor-
mal. : .

“On the other hand, the five chief exporting
countries carried over into the 1949-50 trade
year combined stocks of about 19.8 million
metric tons of breadgrain as compared with a
combined carry-over on 30:June 1948 of 13.5
million tons.

The increase of 6.3 million tons in carry-
-over supplies into the trade year 1949-50 may
‘offset wholly: or in part the decline in the
world’s breadgrain production in 1949-50.

2.. The Outlook.

The acreage seeded to wheat in western
and northern Europe for harvest in 1949 is
less than that seeded for the harvest of last
year. Although weather conditions have im-
proved since April, the outlook as of June in-
dicates an indigenous supply of breadgrain
for utilization during 1949-50, somewhat less
than that of 1948-49 when: an unusually fa-
vorable combination of weather factors con-
tributed to the production of one of the best
wheat harvests in many years. Current pro-
duction of breadgrain in the Danube Basin is
expected to be not greater -and possibly less
than last year while in the USSR there is the
Prospect of a production somewhat greater
than that of 1948. The Canadian crop is es-
timated to be. below the excellent production

 

*See footnote 2 on page 4,

of 1948. In the Southern Hemisphere, where

. Wheat for harvest in the late fall and early

winter of 1949-50 is planted in June-July, no
change from the 1948-49 production can be
predicted as of 1 July 1949. .

In the United States, July conditions indi-
cate a wheat harvest of nearly bumper pro-
portions, but the crop is expected to be some-
what less than that of last year.

It is premature to indicate whether or not
during 1949-50 the world food Supply and 're-
quirement position will be relatively as good.
as or worse than that of 1948-49. However,
indications point to the probabilities that in
importing countries the average indigenous
breadgrain supply in 1949-50 will be consider-
ably less than that in 1948-49, that the aver-
age stocks were below normal and that the im-
port markets of the world may be expected to
take on the average, within the framework of
abilities to pay, approximately the same quan-

tities of breadgrain as in 1948-49,

if a demand situation. similar to that of
1948-49 develops, negotiations for as much as
8 million metric tons of wheat and rye and
possibly more may activate the free markets
of the world. :

If the political situation warrants, it is con-
ceivable that the USSR may attempt to mar-
ket 2.0 million or more metric tons of wheat.
Should this or any other contingency arise,

’ the United States, with uncommitted export

availabilities of more than 4 million metric
tons * should be in a sufficiently strong position
to meet competition on the international free
market, within the framework of abilities of
importers to pay. 7

a, Position of the United States.

By 1948, the wheat and rye production in
the United States was 95 percent greater than
the 1933-37 average enabling an export avail-
ability during 1948-49 of 13.9 million metric
tons as compared with an average export dur-
ing the 5 years 1933-34 through 1937-38 of 1:0
million tons. During 1947-48 shipments to-
taled 13.2 million tons.

 

‘Includes 3 million metric tons more wheat in
storage on 30 June 1949 than carried over in stocks
on 30 June 1948. .

6 conn flrs

On 1 July 1949, the United States entered
the export year with farm and off-farm stocks
of wheat and rye estimated at 8.2 million met-
ric ‘tons. Preliminaty estimates place the

* 1949 breadgrain production at 32.9 million

tons indicating a total statistical supply of
-41.1 million tons.

If domestic disappearance estimated at 18.6
million tons is deducted from a total statisti-
cal supply of 41.1 million tons, a balance for
stocks and export of 22.5 million tons is indi-
cated. Assuming a carry-over on 30 June
1950 of 8.2 million tons (the same as the esti-
mated carry-over on 30 June 1949) a potential
export supply during 1949-50 of 14.3 million
tons is indicated; this is 0.4 million tons
greater than the 13.9 million tons export
availability allotted to the United States by
the International Emergency Food Committee
for shipment during 1948-49.

Under the provisions of the International
Wheat Agreement, the United States was al-
lotted 4.6 million tons of wheat for market-
ing during 1949-50 at prices ranging from
$55.11 to $66.14 per ton. During 1948-49, the
United States consigned to occupied territories
5.6 million metric tons of wheat and rye. As-
suming ‘no decrease in shipments to occupied
countries. during 1949-50, total shipments al-
ready foreseen of 10.2 million metric tons are
indicated. If these estimates approximate
reality, a potential 4.1 million tons are indi-
cated as available for manipulation on the
world’s free markets or for additional stock-
piling at the end of the current trade year.
Additional stockpiling is not necessarily an
unmitigated evil, because the United States
as the chief food supplier to deficit countries
requires a large carry-over to offset any pos-
sible drop in production in the Western Hemi-
sphere or other parts of the world.

b. Position of the USSR.

By 1948, the wheat and rye production in
the USSR was 2.8 percent greater than the
1933-37 average.’ Shipments during 1948-49

* The 1933-37 average (50 million metric tons) is
used for this comparison because trade data for
this period are more nearly complete than for later
years. The conventional prewar comparison base
for production ‘is the 1935-39 average of around 56

million tons. The 1948 production (51.4 million met-
ric tons) was 8.2 percent below the 1935-39 average.

are tentatively estimated at 1.1 million metric
tons as compared with an average export dur-
ing the 5 years 1933-34 through 1937-38 com-
puted to be 0.9 million tons." During 1947-48,
shipments are estimated to have been 1.7 mil-
lion metric tons * and at least 2.0 million tons
of previously accumulated farm and off-farm
stocks of breadgrain were available to the So-
viet Government on 1 July 1948.

The 1948 production estimated at 51.4 mil-
lion tons indicates a total 1948-49 supply of
53.4 million tons. Deducting domestic dis-
appearance placed at 44.6 million tons indi-
cates a supply for export and stocks of 8.8
million tons from which at least 1.1 million
tons were exported, leaving a statistical bal-
ance for carry-over stocks in 1949-50 of 7.7 mil-
lion tons. :

Because of increased acreage and improve-
ment in June growing conditions, there is the
prospect of a somewhat larger production of
breadgrain in the USSR in 1949 than in 1948.
If, as in the United States, it is assumed that
the breadgrain carry-over on 30 June 1950
will be the same as the assumed carry-over on
30 June 1949 (some 7 to 8 million metric tons),
the export availability of the USSR during
1949-50 may exceed the 1.1 million metric tons
estimated to have been exported - during
1948-49,

If political expediency should so dictate,

however, the Soviet Government would not °

hesitate to draw on any obtainable grain sup-
plies for shipment ‘abroad. In that case, a
very considerable quantity of breadgrain in
excess of 2.0 million metric tons could be
placed on the open markets of the world dur-
ing 1949-50, without reduction of reserve
stocks.

 

"Includes surpluses and shipments from Ruma-
nian, Polish and Baltic territories included within

* the frontiers of the USSR as of 1945.

“Of estimated shipments totaling 1.7 million met-
ric tons, 1.2 million tons were consigned to the satel=
lites and the Soviet Zone of Germany, while 05
million tons were shipped to countries outside the
Soviet sphere of influence, :

c. Position of the Satellites,

In 1947-48, because of a very poor harvest,
the satellites, taken as a unit area, imported
(net) 14 million metric tons of wheat and
rye’ in contrast to an average net export of
2.8 million metric tons during the five years
1933-34 through 1937-38. At the end of the
trade year 30 June 1948 turnover supplies were
at a minimum.

Production in 1948 increased materially, and
although a few thousand metric tons of bread-
grain were exported by Poland and Rumania,
1948-49 import requirements of more than 0.5
million metric tons reported by Czechoslovakia
and Finland together with shipments to Al-
bania, placed the area in a deficit position.
On 1 July 1949, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Al-
bania may have entered the trade year 1949-50

. With small stocks in excess of usual turmover
supplies.

Combined’ production in .1949, particularly
because of the poor Rumanian and Bulgarian
crops may not be better and may possibly be
poorer’ than that of 1948. If this situation
develops, the satellite area as a whole may
again become a net importer of breadgrain
during 1949-50 and a liability to the USSR.

4. Position of Western Europe.

During the five-year period 1933-37, West-
ern Europe produced an average of 34.0 million
metric tons of breadgrain. Net imports dur-
ing 1933-34 through 1937-38 averaged 12.6
million tons, indicating an average gross
supply for all utilizations of 46.6 million metric
tons.

‘For the purposes of this analysis, the satellites
of Eastern Europe comprise three countries that
normally were net importers of breadgrain (Al-
bania, Czechoslovakia and Finland) and five coun-
tries that normally exported wheat and rye (Bul-
garia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, and Yugoslavia) .
The Soviet Zone of Germany, which normally
shipped its excess Production of wheat and rye to
Western Germany, is also included.

* About 12 million metric tons of the 14 million
tons shipments originated in the USSR while 02
million tons were shipped by the United States, Ar-
Bentina, and Canada.

“All of continental and insular, Europe west of
Finland, the Soviet Zone of Germany, Czechoslo-
Vakla, Hungary, and Yugoslavia but not Greece.

Production fell off sharply in 1947 to 22.6
million metric tons. Reported combined ship-
ments into the area during 1947-48 totaled 17.7
million tons indicating a combined gross
supply of only 40.3 million tons. Only by
severe rationing, by resort to high milling ex-
traction and adding coarse grain and potatoes
to the bread mix, were non-farm populations
maintained at near subsistence levels. End
of the year carry-over supplies were minimum.

Increased acreage and an unusually favor-
able combination of weather factors in 1948
resulted in a breadgrain harvest of 31.8 million
metric tons—the best in several years. The
International Emergency Food Committee al-
located to the area 16.5 million metric tons to
be shipped during 1948-49 indicating a gross
supply of 48.3 million tons—1.7 million tons
larger supply than the prewar average. In-
creased population as well as more and better
bread consumed by the non-farm population
accounted for the utilization of a large part
of the increased supply. Certain countries
built up their usual turnover stocks to nearly
customary levels. A few countries may have
carried over reserve stocks but, on the aver-
age, off-farm stocks on 30 June 1949 were
below customary levels.

Production of breadgrain in Western Europe
in 1949 is expected to be less than during
1948. Shipments into the area during 1949-50
are expected to be not less than during 1948-
49, possibly 16 to 17 million metric tons, but
may exceed that figure. .

e. Position of the Near East.‘

During the five years 1933-37, the Near East
produced an average of 8.48 million metric
tons of breadgrain. Net imports during 1933-
34 through 1937-38 averaged 0.49 million met-
ric tons indicating an average gross supply for
all utilizations of 8.97 million tons. Although
production in 1947 increased to 8.62 million
tons, combined net shipments into the area
totaled 1.33 million tons indicating a com-
bined gross supply during 1947-48 of 9.95 mil-

Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Trans-
jordan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Aden, Babrein,
Kuwait, Oman, the Trucial Coast, Yemen, Egypt,

lion tons. Increased population and improved

‘diet resulted in greater human consumption
‘during 1947-48 than before the war. Restric-
tions’ on exports together with. speculative
hoarding, however, resulted in some increase
in carry-over by certain countries on 30 June
into the trade year 1948-49.

The 1948 combined production of the Near
East was estimated at 9.63 million metric tons.
In spite of an increase of a million tons in
Production over that of 1947, allocations and
‘shipments of breadgrain into the area are
‘estimated at 1.63 million tons, indicating a
gross supply of 11.26 million tons or 1.3 million
tons greater than the gross supply available
for all utilization in 1947-48. Roughly 0.2
“million tons of this increased supply were re-
quired in Greece to bring customary turnover
“supplies more nearly to normal. Another 0.2
million tons were utilized in Egypt for in-
creasing human consumption and stockpiling.
Fully 0.9 million tons were utilized to increase
consumption or were added to reserve stocks
in Asiatic Middle East—largely in Turkey.
~ Given normal weather conditions, the 1949
production of breadgrain in the Near East,
particularly in the Asiatic Near East, should
be as good as or better than that of 1948. With
‘about a million displaced persons in the area
depending in part upon international relief, a
considerable quantity of wheat will be shipped
into the area to supplement possible intra-
regional exports from surplus producing coun-
tries to deficit areas within the region. At the
end of 1949-50, however, unless policies in Tur-
key and certain other countries change and
unless the situation is altered by other causes,
relatively large reserve stocks of wheat may be
carried over on 30 June 1950. -

f. Position of Northwest Africa:

During the five years 1933-37, northwest
Africa produced an average of 1.98 million
metric tons of breadgrain. Annual net ex-
ports during-1933-34 through 1937-38 averaged
0.31 million tons indicating a domestic disap-
pearance of 1.67 million tons. In 1947 pro-
duction decreased to 1.76 million tons. Ship-

 

‘Includes French North Africa, French West
Africa, French Equatorial Africa, Spanish Morocco
and Tangier.

ments of breadgrain into the area during 1947-
48 totaled 0.23 million tons indicating a gross
supply of 1.99 million tons. Because of in-
creased population (more than 20 percent),
it is possible that customary turnover supplies
on 30 June 1948 were low.

In 1948, production of breadgrain increased
to 2.19 million tons. There is no record of any
allocation to the area, but during the six
months 1 July through 31 December 1948
shipments of 0.22 million tons to northwest
Africa were reported. If no further shipments
were made during the last six months of the
export year, a gross supply of 2.41 million tons
of breadgrains was available for utilization
during 1948-49, or 0.42 million tons more than
was available during 1947-48 and 0.74 million
tons greater than the prewar supply. Unless
consumption has been materially increased
some building up of turnover supplies is in-
dicated.

The 1949 harvest of breadgrain may not be
less than that in 1948, Regardless of produc-
tion and previous increases in supplies, ship-
ments of at least 0.15 to 0.20 million tons to
the area may be made during 1949-50, 7

g. Position of Other African Areas.

During the five years 1933-34 through 1937-
38, the specified other African areas* pro-
duced an average of 494,000 metric tons of
breadgrains. Net imports averaged 90,000

‘tons indicating an average gross supply of

584,000 metric tons. In 1947, production was
estimated at 629,000 metric tons. Combined
net shipments into the area totaled 178,000
tons indicating a gross supply for 1947-48 of
807,000 tons.

The 1948 production was estimated at 644,-
000 metric tons. Allocations for 1948-49 were
placed at 475,000 metric tons indicating a
gross supply of 1,119,000 tons. Although
largely because of increased employment, a
larger population, and lowering extracting
rates, consumption of breadgrain has been
higher in South Africa and some other areas,

 

"Includes South Africa, Basutoland, North and
South Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Tanganyika, Kenya and
Uganda, Zanzibar, Mozambique, Madagascar, Re-
union, Mauritius, Southwest Africa, Angola, Bel-
gian Congo, Liberia, and British dependent overseas
territories in northwest Africa.

it is probable that taking the area as a whole
stocks of wheat in excess of customary turn-
over supplies carried over on 30 June 1949
were approximately 300,000 metric tons.

it is probable that the crop to be harvested
in 1949-50 will be about the same as that
-harvested in 1948-49 and imports into the
area during 1949-50 may-be around 300,000
to 400,000 metric tons. .

h.. Position of Australia.

During the war and postwar period, Aus-
-tralia increased its production of wheat to 6.0
“million metric tons in 1947-48 from which 2.83
million tons were exported and 1.84 million
tons were carried over into the 1948-49 trade
year on 30 June 1948. The 1948 crop was only
5.45 million tons giving a total supply for the
trade year 1948-49 of 7.29 million tons. Do-
mestic disappearance was estimated at 2.21
million tons leaving 5.08 million tons for ex-
port or carry-over.: The International Emer-
“gency Food Committee allotted to Australia
an export quota of 3.45 million tons, leaving
-an excess of 1.63 million tons to be carried over
into the trade year 1949-50.

The crop for harvest in 1949-50 is planted
during June-July, and’ no prediction can be
made (as of 1 July 1949) regarding the produc-
tion expectancy.

Under the terms of the International Wheat
Agreement, Australia’s export quota hasbeen
placed at 2.2 million metric tons presumably
for the year 1949-50.

It is expected that, although wheat used for
feed during the calendar year 1949 will in-
crease 5 percent, exports may reach 3.0 million

‘metric tons attended by a reduction of 9 per-
cent in stocks.. It-is presumable that these
calendar-year estimates may possibly hold for
‘the ‘crop-year 1 July 1949 through 30 June
1950.

i. Position of Far East-Pacific and Indian
Subcontinent. .

During the five years 1933-37, the Far East-
Pacific and Indian Subcontinent area pro-
duced.on the average 34.2 million metric tons
of wheat. Net imports during 1933-34 through
1937-38 averaged 1.2 million tons indicating
@ gross supply of 35.4 million tons. In 1947,
Production increased to 35.2 million tons and

shipments of breadgrain into the area totaled
3.6 million tons indicating a gross supply of
38.8 million tons. The increase in the 1947-48
wheat supply is accounted for by increased
population and extended use of wheat as a
substitute for rice.

In 1948, production further increased to 37:9
million metric tons. Allocations of wheat-to
the area increased to 5.5 million tons indicat-
ing a 1948-49 gross supply of 42.4 million
tons—an increase of 3.6 million tons over the
indicated supply for 1947-48. Japan and
Korea absorbed 0.64 million tons of the in-
crease in potential supply and, in the Philip-
pines, 0.14 million tons additional supply in-
dicates some increase in stocks. China’s in-
digenous supply was increased somewhat by
larger production. It is doubtful if this in-
crease was wholly available to non-farmers in
certain areas because of military activities.
Military activities have also cut off a large pro-
portion of the proposed import supply of 0.31
million tons. New Zealand carriéd a small
Teserve into 1949-50. Part of the wheat
shipped by Australia to New Zealand during
1948-49 was low grade, unfit for human con-
sumption. . .

Food shortages in India and Pakistan de-
veloped early in the trade year 1948-49. Wheat
was required asa substitute for rice and other
grain. Taken as a whole, end of the year
stocks were low.

The 1949-50 production of breadgrain in the
region of the Far East-Pacific and Indian Sub-
continent, taken as a whole, is expected to be
below that of 1948-49. Large shipments of
breadgrain will again be required to maintain
the 1949-50 subsistence at the relatively low
level of 1948-49.

j. Position of Canada.

Canada greatly expanded its wheat and rye
production during the war and postwar period.
The 1948 harvest was 65 percent larger than
the average production during 1933-37.

On 30 June 1948, Canada entered the export
year 1948-49 with farm and off-farm stocks
of wheat and rye estimated at 2.55 million
metric tons. Estimated production in 1948
was 11.34 million tons giving a total supply of
13.89 million tons. Deducting estimated dis-

appearance of 4.20 million tons leaves 9.69
million tons for export and stocks. The In-
ternational Emergency Food Committee allot-
ted. to Canada a 1948-49 export potential of
7.28 million metric tons indicating 2.41 mil-
lion metric tons as the statistical balance to
be carried over as stocks on 30 June 1949.

The 1949 Canadian wheat and rye crop is
estimated at 8.1 million metric tons, Adding
2.1 million tons* (estimated carry-over on 30
June 1949) gives a total supply of 10.2 million
tons. Deducting domestic disappearance, esti-
mated at 4.2 million tons, leaves 6.0 million
tons for export and stocks. Under the terms

of the International Wheat Agreement, certain,

importing countries, chiefly the United King-
dom, have guaranteed to take 5.5 million
metric tons of Canadian wheat. Even if the
1949 harvest is not further reduced, Canada
can fulfill its export quota, placed at 5.5 mil-
lion tons, only by a reduction in stocks.

k. Position of Argentina.

The 1947-48 wheat and rye harvest in Ar-
gentina was 16 percent larger than the aver-
age production during 1933-37.

On 30 June 1948, Argentina entered the ex-
port year 1948-49 with carry-over stocks of
wheat and rye estimated at 1.8 million metric
tons. Estimated production was 4.9 million
tons giving a total supply of 6.7 million tons.
Deducting estimated domestic disappearance
of 3.9 million tons leaves 2.8 million tons for
export and stocks. During the 12 months 1
July 1948 through 30 June 1949 Argentina
shipped abroad 1.7 million metric tons of
wheat and rye indicating carry-over stocks on
30 June 1949 of 1.1 million metric tons.

The 1949-50 Argentine wheat crop is being
seeded on an acreage about the same as for

 

*As of 1 June 1949, the Food and Agriculture Or-
ganization of the United Nations estimated Ca-
nadian carry-over stocks on 30 June 1949 at 2.1 mil-
Yon metric tons.

NTIAL

the harvest of 1948-49. Average yields would
indicate a production not less than that har-
vested last year.

Argentina did not subscribe to the Interna-
tional Wheat Agreement so that any supplies
of Argentine wheat and rye that enter inter-
national trade channels during 1949-50 will

be marketed, as has been the case in the past, .

on the basis of price and convenience.

1. Position of Other Latin American Coun-
tries.

During the five years 1933-34 through 1937-
38, other Latin American countries (excluding
Argentina) produced an average of 1.9 million
tons of breadgrain. Average net imports dur-
ing the period totaled 1.5 million tons indicat-
ing a combined gross supply averaging 3.4
millioh tons. In 1947-48, production had in-
creased to 2.4 million tons.’ Shipments into
the region of wheat and wheat flour were
equivalent to 2.1 million tons of wheat indicat-

. ing a 1947-48 gross supply of 4.5 million tons,

an increase of 1.1 million tons over the prewar
average. Increased population and extended
use of wheat in the diet accounted for part of
this increase in supply. There was some ac-
cumulation of stocks in Venezuela and in some
of the Caribbean islands.

In 1948-49, production further increased to
2.6 million tons of wheat and rye. The In-
ternational Emergency Food Committee allo-

. cated 2.4 million metric tons of wheat in the

form of grain and flour to be shipped into the
region indicating a gross supply for all utiliza-
tion during 1948-49 totaling 5.0 million metric
tons. The increase of 0.5 million tons in gross
supply over 1947-48 is accounted for largely
by the increased allocation to Brazil.

The 1949 combined production in Latin
America (excluding Argentina) is expected to
be not greater and possibly less than that of
1948. Shipments of wheat and flour into the
region during 1949-50 may be expected to be
equivalent to 2.0 million tons more or less.
