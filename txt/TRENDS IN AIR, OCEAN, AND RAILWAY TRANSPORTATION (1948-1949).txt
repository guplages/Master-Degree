TRENDS IN AIR, OCEAN, AND RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION (1948-1949)

SUMMARY

1. GENERAL.

The data which comprise the present study were originally prepared in separate
economic surveys for 1948 and discussions of probable trends in 1949 covering civil air,
ocean, and railway transportation. The material selected is not comprehensive in
coverage but analyzes certain aspects of world transportation and the transportation
situation in sensitive areas which are of particular interest in terms of US national
security. This discussion of current transportation trends may therefore be useful in
the analysis of strategic concepts.

The strategic significance of air, railway, and ocean transportation is not based
on the same factors and their analysis therefore requires differing treatment. In the
case of air and ocean transportation, the fact that equipment is transferable from one
theater of operations to another offers the possibility that it can be utilized in an
emergency by distant powers with sufficient political and economic influence to com-
mand its disposition. Although railway rolling stock can also be transferred, ultimate
control of fixed railway installations accrues to the power controlling the areas in which
the facilities are installed. As a result, the strategic significance of civil aircraft and
merchant ships extends almost equally to all such equipment, wherever it may be tem-
porarily located, whereas the strategic interest in land transportation focuses on those
facilities in sensitive areas. Since production facilities for all three types of transpor-
tation are relatively immovable, a rapid change in the relative transport potential of
any two opposing groups of nations can result from sudden conquest of industrial
areas.

This study indicates that there will be no developments in transportation during
1949 which will decisively alter the relative positions of the USSR and the Western
Powers. In civil aviation the Soviet Union will make rapid progress, particularly in
the organization of its domestic network. The Western Powers, on the other hand,
while not expanding appreciably, will consolidate their position on world air routes.
Although the USSR will lead the world in the quantitative production of medium and
light civil air transports, the US will retain the strategic initiative because of its
superior potential production capacity, as well as its pre-eminence in the design and
manufacture of heavy, long-range transports and of aids to navigation and electronic
airport landing systems. The USSR will continue in 1949 to control a merchant fleet
which is of minor importance in terms of world ocean traffic, and ranks only tenth
among the world’s merchant fleets in tonnage. The Western world, on the other hand,

will continue to expand its fleets. Moreover, combination of the active shipyards of
Western Europe with the latent productive capacity of the US places the Western
world in an extremely strong position to make any required expansion or to replace
losses due to attrition, the most important exception to this fact being the contingent
weakness in the Western tanker position. In railway transportation, the prewar net-
works of both Western Europe and the USSR-satellite orbit have been largely restored
to operation, although much of the rehabilitation has been of a temporary nature in
both areas. Because of the far greater prewar level of Western railway development,
however, railway programs in Western Europe do not include any substantial further
expansion such as that scheduled for the Soviet and satellite rail systems.

2. Air TRANSPORTATION.

The US continues to dominate virtually every phase of world civil aviation activity.
Despite the USSR’s low percentage share of world air-line operations, in terms. of
mileage flown, it is second only to the US‘in this respect. In general, the rate of air-
line route mileage expansion continues to decline and, with certain exceptions, future
expansion will probably be more intensive than extensive. There will be an intensifi-
cation of international competition between national-flag scheduled air lines in a
relatively stable passenger traffic market. The scheduled air lines will also meet in-
creasing competition from non-scheduled carriers. Air cargo traffic, on the other
hand, is expected to continue to expand rapidly. The Soviet Union is by far the
world’s foremost producer of transport aircraft. Its output, however, is concentrated
in light and medium types, whereas the US is the only producer of heavy transports
and probably maintains qualitative superiority in all categories. Financially, the
world’s commercial air lines will continue to be dependent in varying degrees upon
national subsidies.

3. OcEAN TRANSPORTATION.

Increased world competition in merchant shipping and contracting ocean freight
movements have caused a considerable share of new vessel construction to be allocated
for replacement of uneconomic vessels rather than fleet expansion. As a result, the
aggregate world fleet is being increased by only about two-thirds of the annual ton-
nage actually constructed. The inevitable leveling off of the world fleet will not occur
before the end of 1949. Postwar shipbuilding, however, remains considerably below
prewar (1938) levels, principally because of the elimination of Germany and Japan
as major shipbuilding centers and the substantial decrease in US output. The UK
and Western Europe are regaining their traditional predominance in both shipbuilding
and merchant shipping. USSR-satellite production and potential capacity remain far
below that of the Western world. Although the total tonnage of ocean-borne freight
will probably decrease in 1949, merchant shipping, on the whole, will remain profitable.
Decreased cargoes and increased vessel tonnages will cause a decline in international
chartering, although there will be a continued demand for chartered tanker tonnage.

The problems of railway transportation of most immediate concern to the US are
concentrated in Europe and the USSR, where transportation will be most uncertain
and critical in an emergency. The most acute railway problem is rehabilitation, which
is now primarily dependent upon the production and international distribution of
rolling stock. This process continues to be retarded by economic dislocations which
are keeping supply and demand out of normal alignment. Production of railway
equipment is still increasing, but in 1948 the actual production and the great potential
capacity of the US had only a minor effect on other world railways. Production
capacity of the ERP countries of Europe (excluding Germany) already exceeds require-
ments; the drain imposed by German deficiencies, however, will result in a continuing
freight car deficit in Western Europe. With less serviceable equipment than they had
at the beginning of 1937, many railways in both Western and Eastern Europe are now
hauling tonnages approximating or even exceeding those hauled in 1937. Aside from
Europe, there are certain other areas of special concern to the US because of potential
or actual production of strategic materials, in which transportation has exerted a
restrictive influence.

TRENDS IN AIR, OCEAN, AND RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION (1948-1949)

AIR TRANSPORTATION
Predominance of the US in World Civil Aviation.

The US continued to dominate virtually every phase of world civil aviation activity
in 1948, with the exception of quantitative production of civil transport aircraft. For
example:

(a): approximately 85 percent of the world’s civil aircraft were registered in

the US;

(b) scheduled domestic and international carriers of the US operated more
transport aircraft than the aggregate of all European scheduled air lines;

(c). US air lines accounted for more than half of the mileage operated by the
world’s scheduled air lines, though owning less than one-third of the
world’s commercial aircraft engaged in scheduled operations;

(d) each of the five major US air-line systems flew more mileage in scheduled
operations than the air lines of any single foreign country except the USSR;
and

(e) over 78 percent of the world’s commercial aircraft in scheduled operation,
excluding those of the USSR, were of US manufacture.

In 1947, moreover, utilization of the average US aircraft in scheduled operations
was approximately three and one-half times greater, in terms of mileage flown, than
that of the average aircraft of all foreign air lines. US pre-eminence has resulted from
the virtual suspension of civil air operations during the war in most foreign countries,
particularly in Europe, and from generally superior US technical, financial, and opera-
tional capabilities. The US share of the world’s postwar civil aviation activity con-
tinues to be reduced, however, by three inter-related factors:

(a) the leveling off of US air traffic after a period of postwar expansion;

(b) the gradual elimination of wartime disruptions of foreign civil aviation

industries; and

(c) the postwar development of civil air potentials by countries whose prewar
operations were negligible.

Although these factors will continue to reduce the US pre-eminence in world civil
aviation, this trend will not be accelerated in 1949.

Relative Importance of Soviet Civil Air Operations.

The USSR accounted for only 7.6 percent of world scheduled air-line mileage
operated during 1948 (and only 8.4 percent including satellite air lines). Despite the
USSR’s low percentage share of world operations, however, the Soviet Union was second
only to the US in this respect during 1948. In accordance with the ambitious air

transport development program of the current Soviet five-year plan and in contrast
to the relatively static condition of US civil aviation anticipated for 1949, the USSR
may be expected to continue to expand all phases of civil aviation during the year.
By providing rapid transportation for high-priority passengers and cargo over great
distances, in many cases to points not served by other means of transportation, air
transport represents an essential aspect of the Soviet transport economy.

Trends in Scheduled Civil Air Operations.

An indication of the continuing development of world air line routes is given in
the following table of “unduplicated” route mileage flown by scheduled air lines of the
world in 1947 and 1948 (Table A). While the table does not provide an accurate
index for comparison of the civil- aviation activity of the various countries, it is in-
cluded here as the best available means of demonstrating the relative total new-route
development by each country’s scheduled air lines during the past year.

* The following hypothetical case illustrates the manner in which “unduplicated” route mile-
age is computed. A given route, such as New York-Miami-Habana, might be operated by two
US air lines and two foreign air lines of different nationalities. The route mileage would be in-
cluded in the above table twice in the US total and once in each of the foreign totals. Further-
more, the New York-Miami or. Miami-Habana distances would be repeated in the national totals
of any other air lines operating solely those segments of the route.

Over a corresponding period in the previous year (1 October 1946 - 1 October 1947),
US scheduled air lines achieved a 34 percent increase in unduplicated route mileage,
while that of all foreign air lines, exclusive of the USSR, increased 32 percent. Last
year’s figures, 8 percent and 18 percent respectively, indicate the general slackening of
rapid postwar route development. This declining rate of expansion may be expected to
continue in 1949.

The trend of civil aviation in the US and major Western European countries will be
toward intensification of services over established route patterns, rather than exploita-
tion of new routes in light-traffic areas not yet developed. Increases in route mileage,
however, may be achieved by the air lines of India, Egypt, Italy, and the Philippines.
Other countries, such as the USSR and Canada, whose territories cover vast geographical
areas, will also continue to increase air route mileages. Fulfillment of ambitious Satel-
lite civil aviation plans will be dependent upon political considerations and solution of
critical shortages of equipment and aviation fuel.

The accompanying table of weekly air mileage scheduled by the national air lines
of the world (Table B) accurately reflects the relative commercial aviation activity of
representative civil air powers. Comparison with world totals (exclusive of the USSR)
for the twelve-month period from 1 October 1946 to 1 October 1947 again indicates a
slackening of the rapid growth of air transport following the initial postwar develop-
ment. The annual US rate of increase in scheduled operations declined from 9 percent
to 4 percent while the rate of increase in total world-wide scheduled operations dropped
from 18 percent to 10 percent. The US share of the world’s total air-line operations
(exclusive of the USSR), which had been 64 percent in 1946, was reduced to 56 percent
by the end of 1948.

The coming year will witness an intensification of international competition in air
transport. It is unlikely that the volume of scheduled air-line passenger traffic will
substantially increase in 1949, especially since a proposed multilateral introduction of
traffic-generating tourist rates over certain international air routes, if adopted, would
probably not become effective until late in the year. A multiplicity of national-flag
air lines will therefore be competing in a relatively limited traffic market and the com-
petition may be sufficiently intense, particularly on the trunk routes, to result in a
contraction of the more uneconomic services. Increased competition may also create,
in certain areas, pressure for:

(a) reduction of the number of competing carriers through outright merger
or equipment and facility pooling arrangements; and

(b) reservation of some types of traffic to national carriers through govern-
mental restriction of commercial privileges for foreign carriers.

In the absence of governmental intervention, the scheduled air lines also face
increasing competition from non-scheduled carriers of several countries (particularly
the US), which have already developed a significant market for international and
domestic passenger and cargo operations in many parts of the world. The rapid

growth of contract air operations is attributable to several factors: :

. 7 sig:

sugfs
: (a) greater operational flexibility, which is particularly adaptable to the lucra-
tive world-wide movement of displaced persons by air;
(b) substantially lower rates than those of scheduled air lines, a consequence
of small initial investment, as well as low administrative and operational
costs; and
(c) the general lack of. governmental regulation.
One of 1948's major air traffic developments was the sharp increase throughout
the world in the volume of air cargo. This was particularly evident in the operations
of US domestic and international air lines, whose combined ton-mileage for air freight

and express increased almost 50 percent during the year. It is probable that world air
cargo operations will continue to expand rapidly in 1949.

Production.

The following table shows the 1947 and 1948 production of non-combat air trans-
ports in the three principal aircraft manufacturing countries in terms of number of
aircraft and airframe weight produced. It doés not include reconnaissance, com-
munications, or utility and trainer aircraft.

*The term “non-combat transport aircraft” includes military transports. not intended or
equipped to operate in an active combat area, and.conventional commercial transports containing
no provision for specialized military usage. This designation is the only available common de-
nominator which can be applied to US, British, and Soviet transport aircraft because there is no
clear distinction between Soviet civil and military transports.

Quantitatively, the USSR was by far the world’s foremost producer of transport
aircraft in.both 1947 and 1948. Its output, which increased appreciably in 1948, was
ten times that of the US and almost 74 times that of the UK. In the more significant
term of airframe weight, however, the USSR accounted for less than 3% times the US

seqhber 8
Page-11
.

output (the Soviet output was double that of the US in 1947), but over 8% times the
production of the UK. Table C also reveals that the UK produced more transport
aircraft than the US in both 1947 and 1948. The total weight of its airframe produc-
tion, however, was far below that of the US.

The following standard of reference is employed in the ensuing analysis of non-

combat transport production by categories:

(a) Heavy .transport—with design payload in excess of 30,000 Ibs. at a 1,000-
mile tactical operating radius (the tactical operating radius is consid-
ered to be % of maximum range under design load conditions).

(b) Medium transport—with design payload of 16,000-30,000 Ibs. at a 1,000-
mile tactical operating radius.

(c) Light transport—with design payload of less than 16,000 Ibs. at a 1,000-
mile tactical operating radius or with a tactical operating radius of less
than 1,000 miles with any payload.

Non-combat transport production of the US, UK, and USSR by the foregoing cate-

gories is shown in the following table:

TABLE D

PRODUCTION BY TYPES

1947—No. of aircraft
a. Heavy 14 0 0
b. Medium 149 0 61
ce. Light 113 392 2,065

c. Light 2,373 ~ 2,035 15,595

a. Heavy 198 0 0
b. Medium 2,794 0 6,624
ec. Light 3,031 2,343 13,416

Although production in the USSR continued to be concentrated on light transport
types, it is apparent that significant advances were made during 1948 in medium
transport production. This trend will probably continue in 1949. In the US, output
of both the medium and heavy categories was considerably reduced. In 1949, how-
ever, heavy transport production in the US will rise sharply. While other countries
are developing heavy transport prototypes, the US will remain during 1949 jhe world’s

%

only producer of certificated commercial aircraft in this category. It is unlikely that
the UK will become a large producer in the medium transport field in 1949, although
some progress may be made.

Production of non-combat transport aircraft accounted for only 17 percent of the
1948 airframe output of the US aircraft industry, and for about 30 percent of the total
output of the British and Soviet industries. The proportion of combat aircraft pro-
duced in each of the three countries, however, was roughly the same, varying from
60-65 percent. The remainder of US production (approximately 20 Percent) con-
sisted of small civil and military non-combat types which were not produced in quantity
in the other countries. The relatively small proportion of total US output allocated
to transports in 1948 reflects the earlier substantial fulfillment of US air-line require-
ments for new and replacement aircraft. This was made possible by US assumption
of virtually all Allied transport development and production during the war. The
substantial proportion of the Soviet industry devoted to transport production reflects:

(a) the intensive effort of the. USSR to develop a domestic transport industry

for both civil and military purposes; and

(b) the Soviet program for the replacement of obsolescent transport aircraft

on its expanding and vital civil air network.
UK emphasis on transport production is the result of the British determination:

(a) to rebuild the industry after complete cessation of transport development

and production during the war;

(b) to use exclusively British-built aircraft on international routes of British-

flag air lines; and

(c) to develop transport types which can compete in the export market.

In qualitative terms, traditional US superiority in the transport aircraft field has
been maintained, partially as the result of the favored US position during the war.
Current Soviet-designed aircraft are comparable only to the light and medium transport
types which are now being replaced in the US and some other countries by modern

postwar types. The UK has not yet produced an operationally and economically ade-
quate postwar transport.

Financial Prospects for World Civil Air Carriers.

Factors determining the financial prospects for world civil aviation in 1949 include:

(a) the extent of aid through governmental subsidies or possible direct .or

indirect ECA assistance;

(b) the development of the world’s total air traffic potential, which is in part

dependent upon the availability of foreign exchange; and

(c) the degree of political stability in certain geographic areas.

All the world’s scheduled commercial air carriers are dependent in some degree
upon government subsidy, either in the form of direct financial assistance or through
government-sponsored improvement of ground facilities and assistance in the develop-
ment of new aircraft types. The financial status of many US civil air carriers which
operated at a substantial deficit during 1948 has been improved by a recent retroactive
increase in government air mail rates, but will continue to be affected by the extent

SE * 10
Page-13
s 4 .
of future subsidies. While government funds available to the nationalized air lines of
the UK will be decreased, new aircraft recently purchased by the government for use
on the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific air routes will bring greater efficiency, thus
reducing the cost of operations.

The noticeable world trend in 1948 towards a reduction in administrative costs
and duplication of services through inter-company agreements will continue in 1949
and will better the financial position of many air lines. The probability, however, is
that most of the world’s air carriers will fail to turn in substantial profits and will
continue to be largely dependent upon the financial support of their respective gov-
ernments.

The possibility must be anticipated that political developments may arise in vari-
ous areas to hamper commercial air operations. The existing political situations. in
Indonesia and China, for example, have already adversely affected commercial air
operations for some air lines operating in the Far East.

Strategic Considerations.

Although the USSR maintains its lead of all other countries in the quantitative
production of aircraft, it is producing no long-range air transports and its output is
concentrated on light and medium types. The US retains the strategic initiative for
the following reasons:

(a) The US continues to dominate the world’s civil air routes in respect to both

scheduled and non-scheduled air carriers;

(b) The US maintains its leadership in the design and manufacture of heavy
long-range air transports and production of aids to navigation and elec-
tronic landing systems.

(c) The US aircraft manufacturing industry, though greatly reduced from
wartime levels and existing largely on military orders, retains its poten-
tial capacity for mass production of air transports.

OCEAN TRANSPORTATION

Size and Distribution of the World Merchant Fleet.

World merchant marine developments in 1948 and prospects for 1949 reflect a forth-
coming return to the intensive competitive conditions prevalent in the industry during
prewar years. Contracting ocean freight tonnages have caused shipowners to plan
the construction of vessels for replacement of obsolete and uneconomic tonnage, rather
than expansion of their fleets. As a result of this factor, the net increase in the world
fleet in 1948 was only about 2.5 million deadweight tons, despite construction of about
3.7 million. Construction during the current year will probably approximate 3.8
million tons, with about the same relative emphasis on replacement. The inevitable
leveling off of the size of the aggregate world fleet will not occur before the end of the
year.

Table E shows the ocean-going merchant fleet tonnages of representative maritime
nations of the world. Statistics are given for certain years in the decade 1939-1949,
including estimated tonnages at the end of 1948 and 1949. The totals do not include
vessels of less than 1,000 gross tons, those operated on inland waterways, or those owned
by armed forces.

One of the most significant trends in the maritime industry is the fact that the
traditional UK and Western European predominance in international merchant ship-
ping is gradually being regained. This position is being achieved by the acquisition
of new shipping which, by depressing freight rates, has accelerated the laying up of
US vessels. As a result, the US “mothball” fleet now exceeds in size the active US
merchant marine.

Shipbuilding.

Postwar shipbuilding activity throughout the world remains considerably below
prewar (1938) levels, principally because of the elimination of Germany ‘and Japan
as major shipbuilding centers and the substantial decrease in US output. On the other
hand, construction in’ 1948 increased slightly over 1947, and may again increase
slightly during the current year.

Launchings and completions of merchant vessels over 100 gross tons in certain
major shipbuilding countries during 1948 are shown in Table F, together with com-

parable statistics for 1938 and 1947 launchings. The countries shown account for
approximately 90 percent of world shipbuilding.

** Not available.

As in merchant shipping, there has been a rapid resurgence of shipbuilding in
Western Europe (except in Germany), and this area accounted for about 80 percent
of total world construction in 1948. Shipbuilding activity in the UK, Sweden, Italy,
and France was above the prewar levels of those countries. The UK alone, operating
at about 65 percent of capacity, accounted for approximately one-half of the world’s
total launchings during the year and will continue to dominate world shipbuilding
in 1949.

No accurate statistics concerning ship construction in the USSR and the Satellites
are available. It is estimated, however, on the basis of present activity, that the ship-
building capacity of the non-Communist world is at least nine times that of the USSR
and areas under its control. In view of latent US and UK production capacity, how-
ever, the actual disparity is far greater. USSR-satellite production of ocean-going
merchant vessels is unimportant in terms of world shipbuilding activity, most produc-
tion being small inland and coastal craft. The Soviet Zone of Germany is particularly
active in this type of production. Soviet production of ocean-going vessels probably
does not exceed 25,000 gross tons annually, although Soviet construction activity in
respect to smaller vessels for inland water traffic is much more extensive.

Resumption of prewar shipbuilding levels in occupied areas is not yet in sight.
Despite the existence of considerable capacity, western German production will con-
tinue to be unimportant during 1949 unless the present strict occupation controls
on shipbuilding are relaxed. Japanese construction, on the other hand, which was
probably about 100,000 tons in 1948, may reach as much as 250,000 tons in 1949,
principally for foreign account.

Volume of Ocean Traffic.

Despite the fact that the value of world trade in general is expected to increase
slightly in 1949, the total tonnage of ocean-borne freight will probably decrease, as a
result of a change in the character of the cargoes hauled. In 1948, a large portion of
ERP expenditures was made for US coal and grain, rather than fabricated goods. This

year, however, low-weight, high-freight cargoes will largely displace last year’s bulk
cargoes,

Government Control of Merchant Shipping.

In general, the lifting of wartime controls over the major merchant fleets of the
world was completed during 1948. Fleets remaining under state control in 1949 will

be, for the most part, those of countries in which state participation in shipping is long-
standing.

Financial Aspects of Merchant Shipping.

Shipping operations throughout the world in 1949 should, on the whole, be profit-
able. The coming year, however, will witness a wide range in the financial results
of merchant marine operations in various countries. Among the leading maritime
nations whose fleets will improve their financial positions are the UK, the Netherlands,
France, Belgium and some of the countries of Latin America. These countries, for
the most part, added considerable tonnage to their fleets in 1948 through either pur-
chases or domestic construction. On the other hand, the merchant shipping revenues
of several countries, including Sweden, Norway, and Spain, are expected to be well
below 1948 figures. In general, unprofitable merchant marine operations will be largely
confined to those countries which abstain from substantial aids to shipping, or those
countries whose merchant marine revenues will decline because of the expected de-
crease in charter rates and the volume of chartering.

A general decline in international chartering will reflect both the increase in avail-
able tonnage throughout the world and the over-all drop in volume of ocean cargoes
moved. This trend will have a serious effect upon the foreign exchange balances of
a number of countries. The fleets of Scandinavia, Greece, Spain, Panama and some
other countries are far larger than required for domestic traffic and customarily pro-
vide, through chartering, significant foreign exchange revenues. Despite the general
decrease in chartering, several major maritime countries will continue to ‘have heavy
charter requirements because of the inadequacy of their domestic fleets. (The UK, for
example, had about two million deadweight tons of foreign shipping under charter
in 1948, and may not be able to reduce that figure appreciably until 1951.) Tanker
chartering will be especially heavy, since construction for the fleets of many countries
has not been adequate to meet their increased traffic in petroleum products since the
end of the war. At present, almost 90 percent of UK chartered tonnage consists of
tankers. The US, Panama, and Norway, which have surplus tanker tonnages, will be
the principal beneficiaries of the continued demand for such vessels under charter.

For reasons of prestige and to reduce foreign exchange outlays, there will be in
1949 a continuation of the effort of many countries to increase the proportion of ex-
ports and imports carried in bottoms under their own flags. Asa result, some leveling

of the present disparity between foreign trade carried in domestic and foreign-flag
vessels will be accomplished. |

Strategic Considerations.

The peacetime division of the world merchant fleet into numerous national ele-
ments is subject at the outbreak of war to rapid modification into three groups: the
opposing belligerents and the neutrals. Effective control by a belligerent group over
wide segments of neutral shipping can be established by dominant political and mili-

tary strength. Vessels of militarily insignificant countries become in a sense as stra-

tegically important, therefore, as those of major powers. (Norway is an excellent
example of this fact.) Shipbuilding facilities, on the other hand, cannot easily be
transferred and the strategic importance of a given shipyard is qualified by the fact
that it can only augment the logistic potential of the power controlling the area in
which the industry is located.

The major strategic factors affecting water transportation in the postwar era have
been:

(a) Failure of the USSR to launch a large-scale program of shipbuilding which
would give it a merchant fleet large enough to eliminate Soviet dependence on foreign
vessels, and adequate for military commitments.

(b) Practical elimination of the German and Japanese fleets as factors in world
shipping and the efforts of these countries to regain some measure of their prewar
position in both shipping and shipbuilding.

(c) Drastic reduction in the size of the active US fleet and the output of US ship-
yards. Much of the potential capacity of US shipyards remains unaffected, however,
and the “mothball” fleet could be activated in an emergency.

(d) The potential weakness of the Western tanker position, resulting from the
replacement of the US by the Middle East as the major supplier of European oil markets.
This weakness will, however, be largely counterbalanced by the great increase in
tanker tonnage scheduled for completion during the next few years. The Western
position will also be materially affected by the future status of proposed pipelines in
the Middle East.

(e) The threat to merchant shipping contained in advances in submarine design
and in the development of long-range aircraft.

RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION

Introduction.

The most acute problem of the world’s railway systems is rehabilitation, which is
ndw primarily dependent upon the production and international distribution of rolling
stock. This process continues to be retarded by complex factors which are keeping
supply and demand out of normal alignment. On the supply side, production capacity,
except for Diesel-electric locomotives, would be sufficient to meet even today’s abnormal
requirements. However, arbitrary allocation of labor and raw materials to higher pri-
ority industries in some of the most important manufacturing areas prevents the in-
dustry from developing its potential. On the demand side, critical requirements are
frequently not translated into purchases because of: (a) arbitrary governmental alloca-
tion of stringent foreign exchange to other import requirements; and (b) in the case
of| ECA recipient countries, priorities which are established from the point of view
of\broad program objectives rather than the requirements of an individual industry.

World production and distribution of railway equipment, as well as railway traffic, ‘

will be discussed in this study largely in terms of their significance to Europe and the
USSR, since the problems of railway transportation of most immediate concern to the
US are concentrated in these areas.

Production of Railway Equipment.
| World production of locomotives and freight cars increased in 1948 and will in-

crease still further in 1949. As a result, the world-wide backlog of construction orders
will be considerably reduced by the end of the year.

| The US undoubtedly possesses the world’s greatest potential capacity for the pro-
duetion of railway equipment. Although the US produced a considerable quantity of
rolling stock and motive power during 1948, US capabilities had only a minor effect
on, the equipment situation of the railways of the rest of the world. It is apparent from

Table G that, in contrast to 1947, only a very small portion of US production was ex-

ported in 1948. Moreover, 1949 exports will decrease and no equipment exports of any

consequence are contemplated for Europe or the USSR during the year. - (The US will:

furnish, however, certain component parts sufficient for about 2,500 cars to be con-
structed in France.) With respect to the USSR, political considerations have blocked

substantial participation by the US in the rehabilitation of the Soviet rail system.
The sales of railway equipment to Western European countries are dominated by
Policy decisions at the ECA level. The policy of ECA has been to develop and utilize
Western European production to the fullest possible extent, channeling surplus produc-
tion into the alleviation, as far as possible, of equipment deficiencies in western Ger-

many. US raw material resources, in general, have been used for other ECA commit-
ments unrelated to the railway problem. (As a result, the US railroad industry has
not even been able to fill the equipment requirements of US railways.)

Although productive capacity already exceeds rolling stock requirements in the
ERP participating countries of Europe, the drain imposed upon them by the heavy
requirements of western Germany will result in a continuing overall freight car deficit
in Western Europe throughout 1949. Table H shows the estimated freight car re-
quirements and productive capacity of the participating countries, and of those coun-
tries together with western Germany, for 1948 to 1951.

The initiation of German production earlier than anticipated will reduce to about
60,000 cars the four-year Western European freight car. deficit which was originally
estimated at about 100,000 cars. While the new car construction program in western
Germany has progressed satisfactorily to date, however, increasing tightness in invest-
ment funds may have a retarding effect before the end of 1949. The over-all freight
car situation in Western Europe may be even less’ severe than the revised estimate.
Western European car repair programs have advanced beyond expectations and will
considerably reduce the new car requirements of the next few years.

With respect to locomotives, the 1948 productive capacity of the participating coun-
tries was about 415 units in excess of their requirements for 1705 locomotives. It is
expected that during 1949 locomotive production capacity will continue to exceed
Western European requirements. The present locomotive stocks in western Germany
are adequate with minor exceptions in passenger and shunting types which will be
satisfied from internal production during 1949-50.

Only estimates are available concerning Soviet or satellite rolling-stock production.
In order to give some indication of the relative level of their freight car production,
however, the following rough estimates are included. It is probable that the USSR
and Eastern Europe produced about 125,000 cars in 1948, roughly 64 percent of which
were accounted for inthe USSR. Estimated production for 1949 will be in the neighbor-
hood of 155,000 cars, with about 70 percent of this number produced in the Soviet
Union. Locomotive production in the USSR and Eastern Europe is estimated at
approximately 2200 units in 1948 and about 2665 in 1949, with the Soviet Union
accounting for 54 percent and 60 percent of the respective totals.

Equipment Inventories.

Equipment inventories in both Europe and the USSR were affected, in 1948, almost
exclusively by the balance between the internal production and requirement of the
respective areas. (The only important contract between Western and Eastern Europe

19 suger
'
Page-22
SEfRET

thas been the purchase with ECA funds of about 4,000 freight cars in Czechoslovakia for
delivery to western Germany. With the exception of the UK, no countries in Western
or Eastern Europe have had any significant trade in rolling stock with other areas of
the world.)

The railway systems of Western Europe * were operating, at the beginning of 1948,
with smaller inventories of serviceable freight cars and locomotives than those avail-
able in prewar years. Although the total number of Western European freight cars
and locomotives was less than 10 percent below the prewar total, about 15 percent of
the cars and 20 percent of the locomotives were under repair. (The prewar average
of freight cars under repair, in comparison, was considerably below 10 percent.) In
western Germany and France, where war damage to rolling stock was considerable,
substantial progress was made during 1948 in reducing the percentage of cars under
repair. The proportion of unserviceable cars in western Germany was reduced from
about 28 percent to 20 percent, while the French rate was reduced from about 17 percent
to 14 percent.

The railways of the USSR and Eastern Europe ** are estimated to have exceeded
slightly their total prewar equipment inventories by the beginning of 1948, primarily
as a result of substantial increments to Soviet rolling stock since the end of the war.
The prewar serviceability rate for freight cars in the USSR and Eastern Europe was
considerably lower than. that in Western Europe. The current rate is still lower than
in the West, although the differential is not as great. A significant contributing factor
to the relative improvement of the Soviet and Eastern European serviceability rate,
however, has been the existence in that area of considerably lower equipment-mainte-
nance standards.

Table I shows the freight car and locomotive inventories of Western Europe and
the USSR and Eastern Europe for 1937 and 1946-48, as of 1 January each year. While
the information contained in the table has been based on the best available estimates
of conditions within individual countries included in this study, the estimates are
probably not accurate in all cases.

Asa result of increasingly efficient use of limited rolling stock and acquisition
of replacement stock in units of greater capacity, many European railway systems are
now able with less equipment to haul tonnages approximating and in some cases ex-
Page-24
(CRET

ceeding those of prewar years (Table J). In Western Europe, excluding Germany, the
tonnage of railway freight hauled in 1948 was approximately the same as that of
1937, while ton-kilometers performed exceeded the 1937 figure by over 15 percent. Even
including the western German railway system, which in 1948 was still operating far
below its prewar level, the total tonnage moved on Western European railroads was
almost 90 percent of prewar, while ton-kilometers were about equal to the 1937 per-
formance. Soviet and Eastern European railways, on the whole, were carrying in 1948
slightly more tonnage than in 1937, and operated over 10 percent more ton-kilometers,
largely as a result of the postwar performance of Soviet railways. Freight hauled in
1948 by railway systems of the Satellites and Eastern Germany alone, for example, was
still about 17 percent below 1937 tonnages. Railway freight carried in Eastern Ger-
many was probably less than one-half of the 1937 tonnage.

The preceding paragraph indicates that in both Western Europe and the USSR
and Eastern Europe, the 1948 volume of traffic shows a higher percentage of 1937 vol-
umes when expressed in ton-kilometers than when tons carried are used. This reflects
the greater distance the average ton of freight is being hauled under postwar condi-
tions. The longer average hauls in both Europe and the USSR are due to several fac-
tors. Shortages of critical commodities of all types and dislocation of price structures
throughout Europe have resulted in the transport of many products in long-haul rail
movements which normal economic considerations would not justify. Moreover, in
some cases freight movements have been made over circuitous routings because of the
obstruction of normal routes by unrestored rail facilities. In the USSR, in addition to
these factors, a primary cause of the increase in length of average hauls has been the
relocation of Soviet industry and the development of resources and industry in distant
areas in which there was no large-scale production before the war.

Since actual operating statistics for 1948, and in some cases for 1947, are not avail-
able, the figures given for those years in Table J are estimates. As such, they are un-
doubtedly subject to some error.

Strategic Considerations.

The primary strategic interest of the US in railway transportation is concentrated
in Europe and the USSR. It is in these areas that the performance levels of the rail-
ways, in relation to transport requirements in. a future emergency, will probably be
both subject to greatest uncertainty and of greatest. military significance. Moreover,
in view of the present East-West power relationship in Europe, control of the entire
Western European rail network in the event of hostilities is also highly uncertain.

Among the major strategic factors applying to railway transportation in Western
Europe and the USSR are the following:

(a) The approximate balance between the rolling stock production of Western
Europe and the Soviet orbit, although the Western nations probably maintain a some-
what greater potential capacity.

(b) The density of present Western European rail systems, which provides greater
flexibility for large-scale movements throughout the area.

(c) The sparseness of the Soviet rail system in certain strategic areas, despite the
indispensability of this form of transport in view of other transport deficiencies.

(d) The increasing economic and strategic capabilities of Eastern European rail-
ways resulting from ambitious reconstruction and expansion programs including main-
tenance and repair facilities. Substantial portions of these programs will be completed
by the end of 1949. These developments will considerably increase the flexibility of
both Soviet and satellite rail systems and make them somewhat less vulnerable.

(e) Control by the USSR of a system of railways in Germany which, together with
the satellite systems, extends the Soviet-controlled system from the Soviet border to
the Iron Curtain. Although the prewar rail system of the Soviet Zone of Germany
has been drastically reduced, it consists of a network of principal lines which is com-
parable or still superior to other Eastern systems, including that of the USSR.

(f) The strategic disadvantage to the USSR inherent in the change of gauge at
the Soviet border. Although this is a considerable disadvantage to invading forces
crossing the border in either direction, it would be more difficult to convert the Western
standard gauge systems to the Soviet broad gauge for westward (i.e., Soviet) operations
than would be the case in reversed circumstances. é

There are certain other areas of vital concern to the US because of potential or
actual production of strategic materials, in which transportation has exerted a restric-
tive influence on development or maximum exploitation. The major areas of concern
are:

(a) East Africa. In Northern Rhodesia the production of copper has been detri-
mentally affected by shortage of coal supplies at pithead and smelting installations.
Coal supplies are plentiful in Southern Rhodesia, but inadequate rolling stock inven-
tories have prevented the desired distribution of this coal to the areas of operation.
Although efforts are being made to overcome this deficiency, it is not probable that it
will be entirely alleviated during 1949.

Manganese and chrome ore production in this area also exceeds the capacity of
transport facilities which serve the mining operational areas and which connect with
the Port of Beira. Active attention is being given this problem by the US, UK, and
Portuguese Governments and ECA assistance will probably be furnished to increase
both rail and port capacities. No forecast:can be made at the present time, however,
as to the extent this situation will be overcome during 1949.

(b) South Africa. Manganese ore movements in this area are also restricted by
shortages in rolling stock and the unwillingness of the government-owned railways to
allocate additional transport facilities for this purpose. This condition should be
materially alleviated, however, by the delivery during 1949 of about 3,000 Canadian
freight cars. The US has agreed to supply Canada with certain necessary components
for construction of the cars, upon the condition that South Africa will increase alloca-
tions of transport for the movement of manganese ore.

(c) South America. In Brazil, iron and manganese production capabilities
presently exceed the transport capacity available for movements to port areas. In
addition to rail development problems, political factors will probably prevent maxi-
mum exploitation of the ore-producing areas during 1949.

Venezuela’s potential production of iron ore would exceed the present capacity
of transport facilities available for its movement. It is believed, however, that the
necessary rail development will, in general, keep pace with the development of the
mining area, and that serious transport bottlenecks will not deter mining operations
during 1949.

(d) Labrador. The development of the rich iron ore deposits in this area is de-
pendent upon the establishment of transport facilities which, at present, are non-
existent. Construction of a 350-mile railway from the deposits to the St. Lawrence
River hasbegun. Full utilization of these iron ore deposits by the US, however, will still
depend upon the construction of the St. Lawrence seaway which will permit the ores
to be moved in volume to the Great Lakes region. These obstacles will not be overcome
during 1949.

(e) India. India is normally one of the world’s largest producers of manganese.
Movement of manganese ore from India to the US, however, is uncertain due to the
apparent reluctance on the part of Indian officials to favor the export of manganese
under present conditions and to other factors including transport difficulties. The
principal transportation problems which restrict the movement of. US quotas of ore

to port areas are the following: (a) the difficulty of obtaining favorable priorities for |
ore movements by rail under the complex Indian system of rail priorities; (b) the de-
teriorated condition of ore-carrying wagons and motive power; and (c) the inefficiency

of Indian railway administration and operation. It is unlikely that there will be any |
significant improvement in either the quantity or quality of rolling stock available for .
ore movements during 1949, nor is there any evidence of a substantial improvement in

Indian railway administration.
